	<h4>FPG-Aye?</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>FPGA, or Field Programmable Gate Array, is a chip that is capable of being programmed, after manufacture, to digitally replicate the logical circuit of another device. In the case of the Analogue 3D, the Altera Cyclone 10GX is duplicating the functionality of the Nintendo 64, a console that had and NEC VR4300 clocked at 93.75 MHz, an SGI RCP graphics processor clocked at 62.5 MHz, 4 MB of RAM (8 MB expanded), composite AV or S-video output (256×224 to 640×480 max), with 16-bit, 44.1 kHz stereo sound.</p>
	<p>The Analogue 3D is a modern reimagining or reinvention of the Nintendo 64's core hardware with the added benefit of being powerful enough to output at 4k definition, 3840 x 2160 infact which is over 10 times higher than the original hardware's 320 x 240 average, and run in overclocked modes to get the best frame rates out of your nearly 30 year old cartridge collection.</p>
	<p>This review will strictly focus on the console hardware and try not to focus too heavily on the 8BitDo 64 controller (though they pair up purposefully) or drill down too deeply into specific game performance, because there are simply too many to test if you factor in ROM revisions and regional variants across the 388 individual titles that were released for the console.</p>

	<h4>What is 3Dos?</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Firing up the Analogue 3D, you are met with the 3D OS. Now, I wasn't sure exactly what to expect, but I somehow expected more. It's an extremely minimal affair, with just two sections and the bare essentials covered, nothing more. No animations, no colours, and no personality. Even the set up guides and credits are QR codes, which lead you away from the OS to another place to see the latest information.</p>
	<p>Inserting game cartridges, there are some pretty speedy detection and loading times. If the game isn't detected, there is an included cart edge cleaning kit to help with dirty contacts. The second that the cart is seated correctly, the game is displayed, including the number of players and accessories that are compatible. It's a nice touch and shows that they are using pre-determined databases to display this information. Out of the box, there is no cart art, which is incredibly disappointing, given the already monotone OS feel, but there are ways to fix this yourself if you're willing to put in the time and effort, that, frankly, should have been a feature of the OS from day one, or part of the almost immediate 1.1.0 update, to rectify this glaring omission.</p>
	<p>Each game can be configured individually, outside of the global settings. This means that if a game needs a certain save type, or you prefer a distinct screen mode or filter, this can be applied on a per-game basis. Technically the UI is very quick and very clean with these options, but it feels far too clinical and entirely devoid of character or nuance.</p>
	<h4>Unique Tweaks</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Regarding output, yYou have several picture modes to choose from, including "BVM", "PVM", "CRT", "Scanlines", or "Clean", which disables all filters. You also have "Image Fit" size toggles for zoomed, original or cinematic fits on your screen, as well as options like deblur, anti-aliasing, HDR, sharpness and adjustable output resolution. This means that you do not necessarily need a 4K HDTV to use this console; you can tone it down to 1080p for use on almost anything.</p>
	<p>The filter options are stunning. The BVM (broadcast video monitor) is akin to a production-grade screen, PVM (professional video monitor) is one notch down from BVM quality, and CRT emulates a consumer's average cathode ray tube experience from the 90s. These filters add a subtle yet authentic-looking blur to the edges and add a slight RGB-separated bloom to each pixels outer edge, the closer to the edge of the screen the more pronounced it appears, for that unmistakable CRT-warmth that digital TVs lack. Scanlines can also be added to these filters to layer in yet more nostalgia and make the picture appear far closer to the original experience you would remember pre-HDTV.</p>  
	<p>In addition, you also have options (specific to each picture mode) for further tweaking of visual settings such as gamma transfer, interpolation algorithm, beam convergence, edge overshoot, edge hardness, texture filtering, 32-bit colour, region forcing, and more. These give you a plethora of ways to enhance your display to your exact liking, but I cannot help but feel that the darkest colours aren't quite full of enough depth. Perhaps it's to do with the Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG) HDR delivery of the consoles' primary output.</p>
	<p>Lastly, you have the "Enhanced", "Enhanced+", and "Unleashed" overclocking options to help eke out better performance on those games that struggled on real hardware. These modes are quite experimental, but honestly, they enhance your games to cut the N64 some slack in busy or highly bogged down areas. The frame boost is quite significant, but do not expect 60 FPS across all games, as most games ran at or below 30 FPS on the N64 anyway. The quality overall is nowhere near emulation, but none of this is about the emulation of software; in a way FPGA, is the emulation of the hardware to reproduce the original system's nuances, warts and all.</p>

	<center><p>(<i>The screen modes are incredible, it's difficult to capture them for you to see though</i>)</p></center>
	<h4>In-Game Functions</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Pressing "Z" + "Start" or the 8BitDo button brings up an in-game overlay. This is fantastic for altering options, but you can also just simply hit left or right on the d-pad and the 8BitDo or Z+Start buttons at the same time to quickly switch through the picture modes. This is my favourite shortcut on the system for quickly testing picture quality without the text over the top obscuring the visuals. This will override the controls of the game you are currently playing for a couple of seconds, so flipping through screen modes in the middle of a race or during a critical piece of platforming action is not advised. It's best to pause your game first.</p>
	<p>One thing that really aggravates me is when features are demonstrated in the lead-up to a product's launch that don't appear anywhere in the final product. The number one feature I really was looking forward to utilising was the ability to capture screenshots or even videos while playing games. There might be a better way, but currently, I play my carts on my N64, then have to go back in after with an emulator to take some screenshots for my reviews. The Analogue 3D touted screenshots, save states (memories), date and time settings (for RTC?), Wi-Fi and more from their promotional campaign, though sadly, none of those features has yet to appear on the 3Dos.</p>
	<p>I understand that these features could come down in the next update, but what if they don't? What if it takes a year to get these features? I, as well as countless others, bought into the Analogue 3D under the assumption that the features shown in the press kit were coming directly to the console at launch. It's extremely frustrating, but it's sadly how companies work these days, releasing something that feels unfinished and providing patch after patch to massage it back to the standard you expected on day one. Are my expectations too high?</p>
	<h4>Gameplay Guidance</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I tested a number of games on the Analogue 3D, and every single one worked beautifully, even without messing with any settings. The stock setup is great for essentially recreating the authentic look and feel of the Nintendo 64 through HDMI, and for beginners to FPGA gaming, this is configured perfectly enough to just slam in a cart, connect some pads, and get playing with friends.</p>
	<p>Some games like <i>GoldenEye 007</i> and <i>Perfect Dark</i> didn't quite play so nicely with the overclock settings until last week's 1.1.9 update corrected their framerates with unleashed settings enabled. Each update might improve further games, so if you notice a specific game acting up when in an overclocked or tweaked mode, be sure to hit the socials so that Analogue are in the loop, and they might just address the games you have issues with. Again, these issues only occurred with overclocking enabled; otherwise, they play markedly similarly to an actual Nintendo 64 hardware deck.</p>
	<p>The clock speed is not entirely 1:1 accurate either. As noted by friend of the site, <a href="https://x.com/KazeEmanuar/status/1994593656213573709?s=20">Kaze Emanuar, in his recent initial technical tests</a>, the console is not a 1:1 effigy of the original hardware. Instead there are framedrops and 15%+ timing inaccuracies. Hopefully Analogue will recognise and improve on these consumer woes going forward with their updates.</p>
	<p>Regardless, to the untrained eye, these games do look fantastic. Testing and playing around 50 titles, including <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Perfect Dark, GoldenEye 007, Wetrix, Beetle Adventure Racing, Super Mario 64, War Gods, Killer Instinct Gold, Bomberman 64 2, F-1 World Grand Prix II, Kirby, Diddy Kong Racing, Donkey Kong 64, Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey, Power League 64, WCW/nWo Revenge, Quest 64 (and Eltale Monsters), Pokemon Stadium Kin Gin, Pokemon Snap, Taz Express, Stunt Racer 64, Yoshi's Story, Wave Race 64, Quest 64, Spacestation Silicon Valley (disabling expansion pak), Ogre Battle 64, Blast Corps, Body Harvest, Bakuretsu Muteki Bangai-oh</i>, and many more across all regions, I can confirm that the Analogue 3D is a very capable machine, which appears to live up to its 100% compatibility claims. Only further testing or input from others in the community will dispute or reinforce this "100%" claim.</p>
	<h4>Core Compatibility</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As we know, the compatibility with flashcarts started out rough. The SummerCart64 and 64Drive were supported day one, and the V2.xx/3.xx EverDrive 64s that were rocking old 2.13 firmware still managed to fire up just fine, but the X series EverDrive carts would not function at all.</p>
	<p>Krikkz recently rectified this issue by providing a fix that requires you to <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b248">update the OS and rewrite the bootloader</a> before you can begin using it on the Analogue 3D. It's not tough to do at all, and now it doesn't even require you to own OG Nintendo 64 hardware to do it; you just need a 1k resistor. His next update, 3.10, also fixed compatibility running and saving games in "unleashed" overclock mode. ED64 X5 and X7 users were finally eating good again, and the playing fields were once again levelled for all flashcart owners.</p>
	<p>Now, booting up any flashcart shows as an unknown cart in the database, but it does allow you to start it and configure the settings you wish to use while the cart is inserted, as if it were one game. We have already begun seeing the database file being explored and modified, and now we can see flashcarts identified properly and relevant cart art displayed for EverDrive and SummerCart64 at the very least.</p> 
	<p>Homebrew and ROM hacks also work brilliantly on the Analogue 3D with any compatible flashcart. Anything built in Libdragon also works perfectly, as I tested Driving Strikers and Doki Doki Literature Club 64 on it too. The only things I could not get working were converted ROMs using Sodium 64. Using emulators and the cores works fine from a flashcart, but if you convert the ROMs, they don't seem to want to work for me. It could be attributed to user error, but the exact same ROMs, on the exact same flashcart, work for me on my OG N64 hardware without a hitch.</p>

	<center><p>(<i>Each game can be configured individually.</i>)</p></center>
	<h4>Cooperative Controllers</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Wired Nintendo 64 controllers are 100% compatible; I tested every single one I have reviewed, or have in my review queue, and they all worked exactly as they did on my real N64. From the Ascii Tsuricon to the Ultra Racer and the Arcade Shark 64, they all work brilliantly, and you can even run <a href="https://github.com/wermipls/mimi/releases">Wermipls' Mimi Pad Testing tool</a> on them too if you're rocking a flashcart, because they're all wired or use the controller sockets.</p>
	<p>Wireless controllers are also supported. Bluetooth controllers can be connected directly to the console, though only the 8BitDo 64 is immediately 100% compatible. For far better compatibility, connect to a BlueRetro adaptor through a controller socket, and you will find that pads such as the NSO N64 controller and even the DualSense PS5 controller work perfectly thanks to BlueRetro's built-in configurations. I would highly recommend pairing your A3D and flashcart with one for maximum compatibility. A strange example of this is the 8BitDo 64 controller. If you connect it directly to the console in D-Mode (direct input) as recommended by Analogue themselves, the controller works perfectly but cannot be benchmarked. Connecting the same controller to the BlueRetro in S mode, the controller also works perfectly, but it can now be benchmarked. I'm not sure the exact reason for this, but it's interesting to note nevertheless.</p>
	<p>As far as I can tell, using a USB 2.4 GHz dongle to pair a controller through a rear USB socket is not enabled. The OS doesn't have remapping or any pairing functionality yet, so there would be no way to lay out a controller even if it would pair to its own dongle.</p>	
	<h4>Memory Management</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Saving games either requires you to write to a cartridge or use a memory pak, and, just like a real console, it depends on the game which method is required. In the case of flashcarts, you can double-tap reset to force save to their SD card, but with real carts, you must still use a real memory card if they don't use battery backup.</p>
	<p>Games that require a controller pak can make their own onboard the 8BitDo 64 Controller or a wired or wireless controller with a memory card (or a dongle with built-in virtual memory support or a memory card compatible controller socket dongle), but there is no physical onboard management for those MPAK saves within the 3Dos. Instead, you simply need to hold start upon boot to access the memory card management feature of the inserted game, just like a real N64.</p>
	<p>You can switch between the virtual memory card or the rumble pak feature on the 8BitDo controller by pressing the minus button. This only applies to the 8BitDo 64 controller as of now.</p>
	<p>I assume that the USB socket on the rear will be used for something like save states and screen capture or video capture. At the time of writing, they serve next to no purpose whatsoever.</p>

	<center><p>(<i>3Dos is very plain, it's only when you manually add the labels.db that you get cart art</i>)</p></center>
	<h4>Tips & Tricks</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The best trick, first and foremost, is to <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b244">add the labels.db file to your setup</a>. I also mentioned how to do this in <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b237">my first impressions</a> piece on the 24th, and this makes the console look much better. I don't know why this wasn't implemented within the firmware update. Perhaps it will be added soon. Since I wrote that article, people have been tinkering and digging into the DB format. It looks likely that with time we will see custom OS icons for every game. Given that it detects the region, ROM revision and more, it's even possible that it might be able to detect coloured carts too, though that's a lot of data points to collate and get working together, which might slow down the OS.</p>
	<p>We know that the SummerCart64 can play 64DD games natively, and they work on the A3D too, but did you know that a Bluetooth or wired mouse can also be used to control the artist games? Yes, I verified this and managed to get them working satisfactorily, without needing to buy a £300 antique mouse. Accessories such as the Game Boy Camera also work great <i>Mario Artist: Talent Studio</i> and <i>Mario Artist: Paint Studio</i>. Just plug the GB adaptor into your OEM wired controller, slap in a GB camera and get snapping. The <i>Pokemon Stadium</i> games also operate with the GB adaptor, but no ROM conversion or SummerCart is required (unless you're playing a hacked ROM or homebrew); so I can confirm that it works perfectly with real carts too.</p>
	<p>I tested some cheat devices too. Thinking "these are merely passthrough devices", I assumed they would work correctly. None worked for the purpose of cheats, but others worked in different ways. I noticed that users online said that in order to get nonworking ED64 Plus carts working, you could simply stack them through a GameShark or cheat device to get them working. I tested my ED64 Plus, and to my surprise, it worked on the Analogue 3D. Looking at how the ED64 X series is fixed, I imagine the passthrough is sending a different, compatible signal to the Analogue 3D instead of the incompatible one built-in to the flashcart's FPGA hardware.</p>
	<p>For those seeking a more emulation-level of gameplay, using a combination of unleashed overclocking and the clean filter mode, you get the most "emulation"-like settings, though the picture is relatively low resolution and quite blocky but still upscaled to fit a 4K display. We must remember that this is not an emulation-forward powerhouse; it's a 4K version of the original N64 hardware. To anyone expecting 60 FPS and high-resolution textures and the sort, you are going to be disappointed.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>The Analogue 3D FPGA console is technically a great device and good value for money, but it feels incomplete, like Analogue are withholding essential features on purpose, ready to drip-feed for prolonged attention. It does what it says on the tin by delivering a streamlined 4K Nintendo 64 experience directly through HDMI and with screen filters that look incredible, however, it falls flat at offering anything much more than an HDMI-modded N64 with a decent 4K scaler can already do.</p>
	<p>Once the OS updates start arriving and modders and tinkerers get their claws into this, it should prove to be a beast of a machine for more than just N64 gaming. Until then, I am rather deflatedly waiting for all of the promised N64-centric features I thought would be included out of the box to hopefully arrive at some point in the not too distant future.</p>
