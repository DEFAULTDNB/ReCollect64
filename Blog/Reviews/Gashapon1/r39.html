	<h4>Fidget Frenzy</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>In July 2024, Nintendo released a new series of keyrings that featured Nintendo 64-themed fidget devices. The premise is so simple I cannot believe it hasn't been done sooner: take buttons, D-pads, and control sticks and make pocketable toys out of them.</p>
	<p>For almost seven months now, I have been trying to obtain the two available N64 ones. Recently, after sellers messing about and cancelling orders, I managed to snag the analogue stick version for just Â£10 delivered, and I couldn't be happier.</p>
	<p>The stick itself feels exactly like that of an OEM N64 controller; it should, it's officially made and it uses real parts. As a result, it's 1:1 scale to the original and has the same satisfying snap-to-centre as fresh controllers did when bought on the day of release.</p>
	<p>Admittedly, 9 times out of 10, if I have this on my keyring, I'm playing with it. It's addictive and ridiculously compelling to jostle around in your pockets. No one has to know it's there, but that can look weird, so pop it out and show everyone once in a while. No doubt they'll be impressed with your pocket toys.</p>

	<h4>The Key(ring) to Happiness</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The novelty value of these gashapons is immeasurable. Japan knows exactly what it's doing when it comes to vending machines and collectible toys. Opening the shell, ripping into the packet, and enjoying the nostalgia is immensely pleasurable. Every endorphin in your body hits your brain simultaneously.</p>
	<p>The item is a little bulky in your pocket, and it's bound to get battered by your keys, but it's a really nice gizmo for any N64 fanatic to own!</p>
	<p>Now I just need to obtain the buttons version, and I'll have the happiest set of keys in the west.</p>
