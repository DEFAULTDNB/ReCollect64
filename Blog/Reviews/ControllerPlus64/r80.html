	<h4>Out of Control</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Welcome back to another edition of me reviewing third-party controllers for my beloved Nintendo 64 console! This edition pits me against the Controller Plus 64, an unofficial offering that brings absolutely nothing to the table in terms of innovation or comfortability but also manages to devolve the already pristine OEM controller form into something quite ghastly by comparison!</p>
	<p>First and foremost, the Controller Plus 64 was released around 1997 by Joytech, and by way of legalities, it was not allowed to follow the contours of the original first-party controller that was Nintendo's pride and joy, and unless you paid for the privilege, you weren't allowed to duplicate its sweeping curves or ergonomic sensibilities.</p>
	<p>Obviously, Joytech were not about paying for the design, so they went back to the drawing board and, like most unofficial controllers, cheaped out in every possible aspect and fudged it up royally!</p>

	<h4>Gun Grip Gripes</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The biggest selling point of this unit, as opposed to any other controller, was its gun-like grip for the Z-trigger. It's far more curved and pronounced than the original, and unfortunately, far more unwieldy. The squareness of the grips only serves to push the palm of your hand away from holding the stick comfortably. Equally, the outer prongs are jagged too, making for an uncomfortable ride after prolonged exposure. Why they would make this thing so angular is beyond me, but perhaps it was a case of the top brass at Joytech saying, "if Nintendo's is round, make it square!"</p>
	<p>Another "idea" the Joytech wizards had was to enlarge the C-buttons to the same scale as the A and B buttons and removing all embossed textures. In theory this is certainly a radical idea, but in practice it means that you cannot differentiate the buttons quickly using your fingertips alone, and any tactile grippiness is also a distant memory.</p>
	<p>The shoulder and trigger buttons are present. But they don't feel nice and aren't particularly noteworthy. The turbo function doesn't even deal with the shoulder buttons or the C-buttons either. It's just the bare minimum of A, B and Z that get the quick-fire treatment. The slow-mo button is also there, but who the heck actually uses slow-mo anyway?</p>
	<p>The D-pad is yet another misstep, with a mushy, clunky-feeling movement, and I'll be honest, a fuck-ugly design and a 2D feel to it that does nothing for fighting games, nor does it provide any nice use cases for any other games that I tried to use this thing on. This had to be a quick turnaround cash grab to get into the N64 market, because it's utterly devoid of soul.</p>

	<h4>Stick it in the Bin</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>In these reviews, the analogue stick consistently causes controversy, and the Controller 64 Plus is no exception. On the plus side, it has a metal construction for its shaft, but the juxtaposing issue with this is that the stick spins, losing all traction in the heat of the moment.</p>
	<p>The gate in which it sits is also borked. As you can see from the stick benchmarks below, there is not a lot of green going on in those images. These things cannot have been quality control tested; they simply cannot have had any form of constructive critique applied to them before they went on sale. I honestly couldn't understand how these things existed, or why people bought into them, until I found a review for the CP64 in N64 Magazine (issue 19) that gave this an overly enthusiastic 78% score.</p>
	<p>Why would an otherwise trustworthy magazine grossly exaggerate a score this good when this encapsulates the very essence of everything that could possibly be terrible about a controller in one fell swoop> The mind boggles. Avoid at all costs!</p>
