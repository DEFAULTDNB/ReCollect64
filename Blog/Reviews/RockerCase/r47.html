	<h4>Just in Case</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Having initially covered <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b26">RockerGaming's Pad Test Rig</a> in August and <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b59">Project Renaissance</a> in December last year, I reached out to RockerGaming in 2025 to see if there were any items available to review on ReCollect64.</p>
	<p>RockerGaming has kindly provided a sample of their N64 Controller Case, and all they asked in return was for some unbiased, honest feedback, so let's dive in!</p>
	<p>The N64 controller case currently retails on <a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1826432131/n64-controller-case-for-nintendo-64?ref=shop_home_active_2&crt=1&logging_key=6562a6e681efbea3a782d9dd176789dc94b681eb%3A1826432131">RockerGamingMods Etsy store</a> for just shy of Â£29.99 and includes two plastic storage compartments plus a handy TPU stick saver. Here is the official description of the item:</p>

	<p>So you finally got the conch you always wanted... well... sound like you better protect it! There is not better way to protect it than this Custom developed N64 controller case.</p>
	<p>This is a custom solution that has been well thought out and has an all in one approach in mind. The case has a black outer shell, black zipper, black rubber zipper tabs, black handle, and black interior lining. The 2 plastic storage bins are included and perfectly fit extra sticks, bowls, gears, stick caps or whatever else you want to make sure you have extras of. In addition, it has its own stand alone cable storage area with a zip pocket for other accessories or tools you want to carry around with your N64 Controller.</p>
	<p>Finally, a stick saver will be included with each case. The stick saver is a TPU enclosure for the N64 stick that allows the controller stick to be safe during storage or transportation. It can easily slide on or off the stick and allows for additional protection when in transit.</p>
	<p>Controller and accessories shown are for example purposes only.</p>

	<p>With dimensions just larger than that of the OEM Trident controller, you will not be able to store whacky third-party pads in this unit; it's very strictly built to house officially sized and shaped controllers only. This isn't to say that some alternative controllers won't fit. The likes of the Saffun 2.4g, the official NSO N64 controller, and even Ascii pads all fit snugly as well.</p>
	<p>The case has enough padding to survive a mortar shelling. The thick outer shell is tough enough to withstand dropping from waist and even head height; any higher than that is a rather unnatural position for your N64 controller to be in the first place, so you may wish to seek out an anger management course or something.</p>
	<p>The internal pockets have room enough for the cable of an OG OEM controller or anything else you wish to carry if you're storing a wireless N64 controller. One of the compartments also zips up within, keeping items stowed in perfect compartments during travel. The outer zip is also a satisfying blend of rubber-coated metal, which means it's easy to grab and open or close in a cinch.</p>

	<h4>Use Case Scenario</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>To be honest, my initial thoughts were, "Do I NEED a case for my controller? Would anyone REALLY need one?" However, my mind was turned within seconds of opening the packaging when I realised how much thought and design had gone into this product and why it's been developed to this extent. It solves problems I hadn't envisaged, and it's a testament to RockerGamingMod's devotion to the precision N64 accessory-centric cause.</p>
	<p>Depending on how and where you play might just dictate your requirement for one of these. Personally, I have my N64 permanently set up in a cupboard underneath my TV, and my controllers end up strewn all over the place, with their cables tied up with rubber bands. Thanks to this case, I can now have my favourite OEM controller stored properly, not getting coated in dust, and ready to take to friends houses when they next request a pasting at <i>Mario Kart 64</i> or <i>GoldenEye</i>.</p>
	<p>I know quite a few people who could benefit from the ease of portability and protection this case brings to the fore. People who compete competitively, speedrunners, and those with rare or customised/personalised controllers, all of whom will travel with their controllers. I genuinely wish we had these types of accessories back in the day; I would have gladly bought one so that I could transport my controller in style. I would have looked like a professional hitman whipping this out in the 90s, and my friends would have all wanted one too, that's for sure.</p>

	<p>The included stick saver is so simple, yet actually quite ingenious. Packing it in with every case is a masterstroke of marketing too. Who doesn't like a bonus freebie with their purchase? The thermoplastic Polyurethane printed gizmo is slightly flexible, allowing it to simply clip on over your stick, holding it bolt upright and completely static. There is no way the stick is going to accidentally get knocked or leaned against in transit. This thing is brilliant to add to your arsenal of N64 accessories that will keep your collection pristine for longer.</p>
	<p>My only quibble, which is extremely minor, is that the stick saver didn't fit over my <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b24">Hyperkin Hall Effect Joystick</a> that I fitted to my favourite OG green controller back in August. While this is obvious and not to be unexpected, I think it would be great to have N64-style, or GC-style options available at the checkout, just to ensure that any upgraded sticks can also be cocooned in a 3D-printed safety net.</p>
