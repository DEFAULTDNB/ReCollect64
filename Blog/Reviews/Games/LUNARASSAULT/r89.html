	<h4>Lunar-Beats</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>Lunar Assault 64</i> starts out brilliantly by stating that "In the shitty future, Emperor Reagan the Fourth attempted economic stimulus by setting the interest rate to -30%. This resulted in the average asking price of a studio apartment inflating to like, 3 bajillion dollars!". It then goes on to explain that software companies decided to move their employees on the Moon instead, pumping the lunar atmosphere with breathable air ands building housing, but this angered the divine spirit of the moon and she unleashed the Lunarbeasts to scare away the Earthlings!</p>
	<p>This game was an entry for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snZ6kIRLFUI">N64Brew Game Jam 2020</a> homebrew contest made by Daniel Savage over the course of two months, with the theme of "Size". This brilliant entry won him joint third prize!</p>

	<h4>The Work Began</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Playing as Wren Buster, you have to protect the moon's residents from the lunarbeasts that have awakened. Using the L button to target the red weak spots, the aim of the game is to simply charge the satellite with the Z-trigger while hovering over the target to get the things ionised by a giant space laser. It's extremely straight forward, but quite enjoyable trying to gain a position on the beast. Navigating the terrain is done by moving around and jumping (with moon-like gravity) around the mounds and craters.</p>
	<p>The story goes that Wren's passion was to become a Lunar spotter, protecting the moon from the Lunarbeasts, but as you progress you find that Wren becomes a lazy sod and gets exhausted quickly. Considering this job a hobby rather than a viable career, he ultimately hands in his notice and resigns from the post. It's a quick story-arc but it's an engaging one nonetheless. The engine for dialogue is well done too, with each character's 2D portrait leaning in to say their piece, and the A button progressing the text.</p>

	<h4>Battling Beasts</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Playing as Wren Buster, you have to protect the moon from the Lunarbeasts that have awakened. Using the L button to target the red weak spots, the aim of the game is to simply charge the satellite with the Z-trigger while hovering over the target to get the things ionised by a giant space laser cannon. It's extremely straightforward, but quite enjoyable trying to get a position on the beast. Navigating the terrain is done by moving around and jumping (with moon-like gravity) around the mounds and craters, but the graphics, while pretty neat, it does have a serious amount of pop-up.</p>
	<p>The sense of scale is fantastic. Each beast is bigger and badder, has different movement patterns, and has a greater number of weak points to strike. It's tricky to get the grasp of the charging and blasting, but essentially, if you have the reticle over the red diamonds as the laser hits its peak, and you're close enough in proximity, you can blast them away in next to no time. Trying to keep the reticle on the spots for the entire charge-up is almost impossible while tracking and moving about, but getting it over the spot at the last possible second is the key to smashing it.</p>
	<p>There is no weapon variety, no points to score, and no damage that can be taken, so a little of the jeopardy of the situation is lost, in my opinion. There is, however, a clock ticking down that you must beat for each beasty and a man from corporate who has a sharp tongue and gives you an amusing back-and-forth between each bout.</p>

	<h4>Post Slaying</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>	<p></p>
	<p>Lunar Assault 64</i> is undoubtedly a great demonstration, but it's so painfully short that it makes me wonder why nothing more ever came of it. The scope for a game like this is huge, but the 20-ish minutes it takes to complete the prologue, three chapters, and the epilogue is far too swift. Just as you're getting into it, it's over!</p>
	<p>Forgiving the pop-up and the clunky controls, there is a husk of something brilliant here, and something I could have seen as a full retail game in the early years of the N64's reign.</p>
	<div class="col-container">
	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>First and third-person gameplay.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Cutscenes and dialogue throughout.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Huge sense of scale across the terrain.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Controls are simple to pick up.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Extremely weird control style.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Only 3 beasts to ionise.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Just 5 chapters and 20-ish minutes of gameplay.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>Daniel Savage's Lunar Assault 64 is a fantastic homebrew title that is entirely worthy of your time. It's got a good storyline and interesting gameplay, but it's far too short.</p>
	<p>It works perfectly on real hardware, and even with Rosale's Mupen GUI, though while emulated sometimes you have to hammer the start button to bypass the cutscene, because it can freeze and prevent you starting the game.</p>
