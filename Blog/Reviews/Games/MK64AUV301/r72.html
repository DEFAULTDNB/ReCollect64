	<h4>Full MOT & Service</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>What if <i>Mario Kart 64</i> had been given quality-of-life updates, new modes, and more tracks to race? Well, skilled MK64 modder Litronom has been answering that question since 2020 with his "Amped Up" modification of the classic racer, and that's without using anything to do with the decompilation!</p>
	<p>This version, V3 (V3.01 with the current bug fixes), gives the game several more new features than its previous iterations, including fully animated 3D character models, 16 brand-new courses, and 5 new game modes, in addition to the existing OG MK64 tracks, cups, and trophies. This means that you have incredible visuals and options, regardless if you're playing on a console or emulation, plus a full 32 tracks are included in the ROM!</p>

	<h4>A New Dimension of Play</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>MK64 Amped Up</i>'s unique selling point (note: the mod is entirely free!) for this version is its stunningly detailed 3D racers. Prior to this, <i>Mario Kart 64</i> used sprites of pre-rendered models, which animated cleverly to convey direction without a 3D model in sight. The technology wasn't unlike Rare's implementation of the characters in <i>Donkey Kong Country</i> for the SNES. As a matter of fact, the beta of MK64 was known as <i>Mario Kart R</i>, where the "R" stood for rendered, because it was all rendered to look 3D!</p>
	<p>Litronom's implementation means that fully animated and highly detailed 3D models are now included, though you can still toggle between the 2D sprites or the 3D racers, depending on your preferences. The 3D models look incredible, and they make the game look so different it's astounding. There is no notable impact on the overall performance either, so having fully 3D racers in the 64-bit racer could have been possible back in the day had Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis & Development team really pushed the boundaries!</p>
	<p>In addition to the 3D-modelled 8-strong main cast, there are countless new objects and geometry included throughout the new levels too. There is also an unlockable model viewer so that you can admire all the new bits and pieces, though one notable feature missing is any additional or replaced playable characters (*cough* Kamek *cough*), if you don't count the frogsâ€”I have said too much!</p>

	<h4>Expansive Modes & Tracks</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>MK64's original 16 tracks remain, but when you come to the track/cup select screen, you can flick the stick upward to toggle between classic "64" tracks and the new "AU" (Amped Up) cups and courses. The new tracks include Ancient Lake (from Diddy Kong Racing!), GCN Mario Circuit, Tsumuri Beach, Kalamari Canyon, SA2B Route 64, SNES Mario Circuit 3, Green Greens, SMW Raceway R/T, DS Wario Stadium, Kiki KaiKai Shrine, Secret Slide, 3DS Neo Bowser City, Hazy Maze Cave, Yoshi's Riverbed, Sandy Slide, and Carnival Realm.</p>
	<p>Each level has been expertly crafted by a team of modders and creators using the <a href="https://github.com/DeadHamster35/Tarmac64">Tarmac toolkit</a> from <a href="https://overkart64.com/">Over Kart 64</a>, a <i>Mario Kart 64</i> ROM editing tool that facilitates the building and injection of custom tracks. Credits for the additional content in Amped Up V3 go to Litronom, Deadhamster, Hoothoot, Andratva, Stinger O Wanjiro, Midiguydp, Ifatov, Pabloscorner, Gekotsumuri, Skelux, Kurkomods, MK64mr, Mariopower55, Beck Abney, Snooplax, Phantombane, M4nu P, Paddy Kroetz, and The Overkart64 Discord.</p>
	<p>I particularly love the tracks incorporated from newer games, such as Mario Kart Double Dash, Mario Kart DS, and Mario Kart 7, because these simply didn't exist in 1996, so it's strangely nostalgic to play on them in thoughtfully de-made 64-bit homages. My personal favourite is SA2B Route 64. It's crisp, clean, and has an awesome <i>Crazy Taxi</i>-style realism to it, which I really enjoyed!</p>
	<p>There are three main additional modes for Amped Up V3, which include "Balloon Race", where you must hold onto your balloons to win; "Elimination", where you must place above the last place racer to avoid losing; and "Coin Mode", where you must collect 8 purple N64 coins per track. There is also "Mini Turbo Mode" and "Target Zones" for time trial mode. Mini Turbos requires you to do as many little boosts as possible, and Target Zones is like racing through checkpoints; don't miss one, or else you'll fail.</p>
	<p>The inclusion of these extra modes definitely ramps up the fun and gives players even more reasons to come back and play the game again and again. I love the little tweaks, like being able to adjust the number of racers, seeing button inputs, the ability to change settings without having to hammer "B" to go right back to the beginning, seeing your total GP time each race, random character and track select, and the cumulative Grand Cup, which incorporates all cups into one uber-grand-prix.</p>

	<h4>Satisfaction Guaranteed</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>To say that this creation is amazing would be an understatement. I don't think I have ever been so glued to a ROM hack, nor played it for so long and so excitedly. It's because this one is different. It feels like an amalgamation of <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i>'s visuals, mixed with fresh and inviting tracks and brilliantly replayable modes, such as elimination and coin races. It doesn't just feel like an upgrade; it feels like a brand new game.</p>
	<p>Beating each track, on each CC and with each mode stacks up to a huge amount of gameplay and a massive amount of replayable fun. The only thing missing here is battle mode, which, I'll be honest, was never the main attraction of a Mario Kart game anyway. Selecting battle mode simply returns you to the mode select, because it hasn't been implemented yet. Hopefully in the future we may see battle mode included and perhaps new characters and battle arenas, though having reached out to Litronom, I was informed that the restrictive ROM space means that with all the new tracks, audio and 3D models, there isn't enough space to add any new racers.</p>

	<h4>Bonus Bonanaza</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Amped Up V3 has a triple-A abundance of unlockables and a handy tracking screen to keep you informed of your collections and achievements. You can track trophies, coins and notes collected, as well as unlock goodies for performing 100 hops or even witnessing the sad 4th place ending.</p>
	<p>Unlockables include frog mode, stupid steering, jukebox, CPU challenge (sleepy to insane settings), GP balloons, GP racer count, free item box, drift particles, funny voices, and N64 coins galore mode. There is so much to toggle and play with that this cannot be completed in one playthrough. What's more, getting four players together on a couch and competing with each other on fresh tracks brings back those 90s vibes. There really is quite nothing like it!</p>
