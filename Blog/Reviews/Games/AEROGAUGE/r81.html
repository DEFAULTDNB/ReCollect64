	<h4>Racing Reinvented</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>AeroGauge</i> is a futuristic racing title on the N64, which debuted in Japan on December 19, 1997. The rest of the world got to experience the Aeromachines in the following March (EUR) and May (USA) of 1998, and the game notoriously received mixed scores at the time due to its lack of content and inability to match <i>F-Zero X</i> or <i>Extreme-G</i> for thrills.</p>
	<p>I remember playing this game a little on my DR V64, but I have zero memory of anyone ever requesting to play it, or anyone I knew with an N64 owning it or borrowing it from Blockbusters. Regardless, let's see how it holds up today!</p>

	<h4>Futuristic Fashion</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>AeroGauge's backstory is kind of like <i>WipeOut</i>, where corporations want to flex in the racing world; it's easily forgettable. You start out with options for Grand Prix, Single Match, Time Attack, or Versus if you have friends willing to give this a bash. There are 5 machines to choose from at the beginning, including Interceptor, Hornet, Avenger, Shredder, and Black Lightning, though completing the game on expert difficulty with various racers unlocks Dominator, Prowler, Reaper, and Vengeance for use in all modes (there is also an N64 controller ship that can be unlocked through cheats too!). Each Aeromachine has unique characteristics interms of handling, top speed, and durability, so you essentially pick your favourite based on acceleration and agility.</p>
	<p>There are also 4 tracks, Canyon Rush, Bikini Island, Chinatown, and Neo Arena, but two more levels can be unlocked by coming first on the GP. These additional levels are Chinatown Jam and Neo Speedway. The levels are varied and vibrant, with definite nods to <i>F-Zero X</i> and <i>Wave Race 64</i> beta images coming through by way of all the funnelling pipes and tunnels, and the Bikini Beach level is somewhat similar-looking to <i>Wave Race 64</i> and <i>Hydro Thunder</i>, which is a refreshing visual break from the mainly urban environments.</p>
	<p>The Grand Prix mode lets you qualify each stage with 2 laps, then you race against seven other competitors, starting off in your qualifying position. Hitting speeds of over 500 in-game miles per hour, the game is very rapid and very twisty. My pro tip is to hold B+A at the start, release B when it says "Ready", and you'll get a nice boost right out of the gates. You'll also need to learn to drift with Z, release A+Z and hit A again when exiting a corner to maintain and build speed around corners. Without that turbo technique, it's sometimes a difficult game of catch-up with the other AI racers, who all seem to know how to turbo boost at every juncture. It's not easy to pick up nor pull off these mechanics, but, sadly, they are essential to win, even on lower difficulties.</p>

	<h4>AeroGrudge</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>This game has notable foggy pop-in, which detracts from the experience, but the graphics certainly whizz past at a belting speed. The controls are nicely simplistic, and the handling actually feels quite nice considering how fast the gameplay is, with the drift button allowing you to slide around corners once you know the levels. You can also ascend or descend in height to navigate obstacles or take alternative routes within certain tracks. I found this game hard, really hard. It's mostly down to having to boost at every corner, and the mechnics sometimes sporadically kicking in and responding to you doing that.</p>
	<p>Overall experience is ok in my honest opinion. I like the feel of the vehicles; they aren't too floaty, and they can be perfectly responsive, which is great in a pinch. The other vehicles don't pose any threat, nor do they really interact with you, which is disappointing. It's rarely the AI that causes you any bother; it's normally forgetting what's at the next blind turn, thanks mostly to the pop-up. If you don't know the levels, you will smash up your vehicle and lose all your health on the damage gauge, causing you to retire. Practice mostly makes perfect; memorise those tracks, learn to boost, and you MIGHT succeed if the games unfair-feeling jankiness doesn't inhibit you.</p>
	<p>The music in this game is horrible. It loops, and it sounds so clunky and remedial in comparison to most N64 games. I honestly couldn't stomach much of it each sitting. It's arcadey-sounding but mentally aggravating. All in all, you couldn't sit and play this for hours on end; it's a 10-15 minute thing, and then you're done with it until the next time you pick it up to try to beat another difficulty. It's all a bit basic and bland in design, scope and excitement.</p>

	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Speedy gaming with nice feeling controls.<br>

	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p><i>AeroGauge</i> is nowhere near as fun and gripping as <i>F-Zero</i>, nor is it as action packed as <i>Extreme-G</i>, so it sits somewhere in the middel of the review scale with not a lot of lasting appeal.</p>
