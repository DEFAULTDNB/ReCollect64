	<h4>Still (Un)alive</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When the Portal 64 demake was announced back in 2022, I was elated. Portal is one of my all-time favourite games, encompassing puzzle elements within a first-person shooter/platformer. My FPS addiction came from the N64, with <i>GoldenEye 007</i> and <i>Duke Nukem 64</i> starting the habbit of a lifetime. With a robust physics engine, I was eager to see how this would translate to the Nintendo 64.</p>
	<p>I originally played Portal 64's beta at the first chance possible, compiling James Lambert's (of <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b13" target="_blank">N64 VR</a> fame) project and producing a Z64 ROM to test on my Everdrive. I fired it up and was blown away by just how incredible it was already looking. But there wasn't much substance to the first alphas, a few levels here, a sneak peek of features to come, and a plethora of possibilities.</p>
	<p>Recently, I poked around the now-cancelled project; it was pulled in January 2024 over legal concerns raised by Valve about using Nintendo's SDK tools, rather than something completely legal and open-source, like <a href="https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon" target="_blank">LibDragon</a>. The good news is that the game made it out of beta before any of this happened. </p>
	<p><i>Portal 64: First Slice</i> (version 0.14.0) was released in 2024. I managed to find the last available beta, version 0.15.0, and I dove in, ready to check out what progress had been made since I last checked it out two years ago. For how early the progress is, it's incredibly playable and unbelievably feature-rich. The bad news is that it's massively unfinished, but it doesn't take anything away from the playability and the completely unbelievable feeling of playing a game from 2007 on your 64-bit Nintendo console!</p>

	<h4>GLaDoS of The Opportunity</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Controlling the game was awkward at first; I had to swap the c-button walking setup to the stick and put the looking/aiming controls back onto the c-buttons.</p>
	<p>In general, the controls are easy to get to grips with. The L button is used to duck, R is for interacting, Z is used to jump and A/B will fire portals when you obtain the titular gun.</p>
	<p>From the jump, you have GLaDoS barking at you, the music playing in the test chamber, and the iconic look and feel of source games is captured 1:1. When you're walking around with the gun, it also does the little shake animation you know and love. It's unbelievable that this isn't a direct port. Sure, the textures are super low resolution, but my goodness, it manages to look the part!</p>
	<p>Scrambling through a few test chambers, I noticed just how smooth the framerate was; it's astoundingly slick. I also noticed how the physics do exactly what I would expect them to; it's possibly the most faithful reproduction of the physics-based title you could have wished for. The developer did a truly amazing job of making this a perfect replica.</p>
	<p>There are a couple of minor bugs, but they're mainly triggered by trying to get ahead of the game and rush through. If you take your time, you'll have a way better experience. This goes to show that the game though incredibly well made, wasn't put through a final bug check. It stands to reason, but it's still sad to think that this might never happen.</p>

	<h4>Cake Was a Lie</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Nintendo loves sending out "Cease and Desist" letters. I couldn't count the number of times a great project has popped up only to be nerfed by Nintendo's lawyers.</p>
	<p>If Portal 64 can at very least get ported over to the open-source library, I think that this will revolutionise what people can expect from N64 homebrew. Imagine <i>Half-Life</i> demakes, <i>Counter-Strike</i> or <i>Left 4 Dead</i> Style multiplayer games, and even brand-new games based on Lambert's bespoke engine.</p>
	<p>As it stands, Portal 64 is an absolute must-play for anyone with a flashcart and a lust for incredible gaming on their N64. You just need to find it yourself, because I cannot link any of the files here.</p>
	<div class="col-container">
	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>An astounding recreation.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Physics engine is spot on.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Excellent sound & lighting.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>19 test chambers to navigate.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Some bugs & glitches.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Project status: cancelled.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>Another proof of concept homebrew game that sadly ended up cancelled. There is a glimmer of hope though, as James Lambert has recently been streaming tutorials about developing N64 games with LibDragon.</p>
	<p>Until then, this demake is the epitome of what N64 homebrew should embody and I hope it gets ported and continued, because it demonstrates unparalleled quality throughout.</p>
