	<h4>Visual Novelty</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>If there is one genre the Nintendo 64 is lacking, it would be the text-based button mashers that are visual novels. Back in the years 1996 through 2000, visual novels were not really considered as entertainment in comparison to the predominantly action/adventure-filled 3D platform that showcased the Nintendo 64's processing power and graphical abilities. Thusly only one game, the Japanese exclusive <i>Yakouchuu II: Satsujin Kouro</i>, was made for the 64-bit console to fill this niche, that is, until recently!</p>
	<p>Having reviewed <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r56">Spooky Iluha's fantastic <i>Driving Strikers</i> homebrew port</a> back in May, I decided to check in on what else they were capable of crafting for my beloved console. I stumbled upon a port of <i>Doki Doki Literature Club</i>, a game from 2017 that I had certainly never dabbled with before and something that the Nintendo 64 had never seen in it's lifetime.</p>

	<h4>Begin Button Bashing</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Based on the free-to-download original game by Team Salvato, this N64 fan port sucessfully brings across the existing assets into the Libdragon VNE, as well as cleverly supporting mods and translations on the fly! Check out the exact list of features below:</p>
		<div class="container">
	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p><b>Libdragon Visual Novel Engine Features:</b></p>
	<p>Automatic translations support for any game with a powerful translation system built into the engine itself</p>
	<p>Automatic mod support for any game with a mirrored filesystem in a game_mod_folder directory on flashcarts and emulators with SD card support</p>
	<p>Ready-made saving mechanics onto an EEPROM, including autosaves, manual saves and persistent saves</p>
	<p>Powerful scripting engine and .script files for narrative tropes, no coding required</p>
	<p>Customizable backgrounds, configs, cg images, composited character expressions and much more</p>
	<p>Extensive API for all the game features including audio and music, filesystem, scripts and images</p>
	<p>Multilanguage dictionary support for all the game's GUI elements</p>
	<p>Makefile script that automatically builds a .DSO game that can also be used as a mod for other Libdragon VNE games</p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
	</div>
	<p>The innovation behind the port is incredible, though sadly for me, the content that this wondrous engine can bring to the Nintendo 64 (in my honest opinion) is rather monotonous. Far too many clicks before anything interesting actually happens. There are an estimated 77,000+ words to wade through, which includes completing all branches and listening to the main 10,000-word monologue. Sigh.</p>
	<p>For those who don't know, this "game" is almost entirely about hitting the A button every couple of seconds to progress the story forward, and when I say story, I mean a psychological horror game disguised as a light-hearted dating simulator visual novel. No, all is not what it appears with the sugar-sweet visuals and girls throwing themselves at you with poetry. Sure you get to pick a bunch of words a bunch of times, before the game switches into its chaotic phase, but regardless, I found it rather boring.</p>

	<h4>Knickers in a Knot</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As a non-anime fan, I genuinely think that I found the introductory sickly-sweet-yet-weird narratave more discomforting than the darker, edgier subject matter of depression, self-harm, abuse, and mental health. I had to double-check, but yes, the characters are 18+ years of age, thank goodness, but it definitely leans into an awkward teen culture that I, a 40-something man, clearly cannot connect with.</p>
	<p>Without giving too much away, you are essentially the main protagonist and you join a book club at the request of your friend Sayori. You meet Yuri, Natsuki, and Monika, and the game morphs from an overly friendly school-like experience to a situation where you're meant to believe that one of these characters is self-aware and taking control of your game, physically tampering with the games files. There is a tangled web of psychological events to unravel in here, but I wasn't hooked on the subject matter for whatever reason, regardless of the fourth-wall-breaking gameplay that is supposed to draw you in.</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>LibdragonVNE is incredible.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Copious amounts of text to read through.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>The game certainly takes weird twists.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>I found DDLC long and uninteresting.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>I have to applaud the smoothness and versatility of the engine in use, but personally this "game" is not for me. The horror and jumpscare elements are a neat twist, but I never felt as shocked as I assume I should have, which is disappointing.</p>
	<p>For bookworms, Visual Novel buffs, and horror fans, this is definitely worth visiting, but personally, I'm not a big enough fan of the VN genre to fully appreciate this.</p>
