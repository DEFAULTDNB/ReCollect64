	<h4>Making a Splash</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>Wave Race 64</i> holds a particularly special place in my heart because I have an incredible story attached to just how I came to own this aquatic racing game in 1997.</p>
	<p>Essentially, some friends and I were climbing rocks at a park; my friend fell off and gouged his leg open. Thinking quickly, I used one of my socks to tourniquet it shut and carried him back to his parents, where he got taken to the hospital for stitches.</p>
	<p>As a reward for my actions, my parents allowed me to select an N64 game to bring home, and I chose Wave Race 64. With its captivating synth-driven music, engaging physics-based gameplay, and an enthusiastic announcer, this game quickly became one of my all-time favourites, and I would be lying if I claimed I had not played it at least a few times already this year.</p>

	<h4>Lush Locales</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>Wave Race 64</i> sports four characters, Ayumi Stewart, Ryota Hayami, Dave Mariner, and Miles Jeter, each with a racing profile that differs enough to span a couple of weight/handling classes. Auymi has great acceleration but poor top speed, Ryota has middling stats, Dave has top speed but zero handling, and Miles is the man for handling, but he's got no grip whatsoever.</p>
	<p>The game contains a championship mode, two-player versus, time trial, and stunt modes. The championship is categorised into normal, hard, and expert, containing 6, 7, and 8 courses, respectively, and pits you against three CPU-controlled adversaries. Normal is extremely easy to beat, so I highly suggest kicking it up a notch to make the challenge harder (they add spiky mines to trip you up) and race the full roster of tracks.</p>
	<p>The courses include Sunny Beach, Sunset Bay, Drake Lake, Southern Island, Marine Fortress, Port Blue, Twilight City, Glacier Coast, and of course, Dolphin Park. Each one has their own individual theme, and each one complements the game in giving the players variety and excitement. Where Drake Lake is small yet serene and gradually fades out the trademark N64 fog to reveal beautifully reflective flats, Southern Island is vast with swelling waves, boardwalks, a wreck, and tidal changes to navigate. Glacier Coast is cool, crisp, and fresh, with a good dose of ice sheets, whereas Twilight City is dark, twisty, and aggressive.</p>
	<p>Sunset Bay, as you would imagine, has stark oranges punctuating the environment, really packing that sunset vibe into the stage. Each stage has its quirks, but the full set makes for a truly arcade-worthy line-up of levels that leave you feeling like nothing has been left out.</p>
	<p>The stunt mode is fast, fun, and frantic especially if you don't have the moves dialled into your muscle memory. You need to complete laps while going through rings and accumulating the highest score possible by tricking all the way around. There are four ramp tricks and four vehicular flourishes to remember, so by today's standards, it's not too taxing, but fitting them all in to get a perfect run can be challenging for the uninitiated.</p>
	<p>Finally, the two-player mode is exceptionally good fun, with split-screen action and very minimal amounts of detail notably cut down. While it is a great addition to the single-player modes, it's a shame there was no four-player multiplayer, because THAT would have rocked.</p>

	<h4>Phenomenally Playable</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With physics as the mainstay of this title, every aspect of the gameplay is affected by simple actions and fine details. For example, after selecting your character, you can customise your watercraft's specifications by adjusting handling (light/heavy), engine (dash/top end), and grip (loose/tight) to find your perfect balance regardless of who you have chosen to ride as. The combination of light/top end/loose allows for the snappiest acceleration but quick, unstable turning, whereas heavy/dash/tight offers the most stability and the highest speed in a straight line, but it's sluggish when attempting to turn quickly.</p>
	<p>The water in this game is incredible. There are no other words to describe it. In 1997 this was an unbelievable tsunami of eye candy, with the waves swelling and bobbing, glistening with a realistic candour throughout. The atmosphere is electric, and if you grew up with this game, the nostalgia and wow factor hit every single time you replay it. You need to understand that games simply never looked this good back then. <i>Wave Race 64</i> perfectly displays (and still does) the stunningly visual paradigm shift in terms of its physics simulation-to-graphics ratio on the fledgling 64-bit system when held in comparison to its SNES forefather and various competitors 32-bit offerings.</p>
	<p>The way the riders hold onto their vehicles through inverse kinematics is also remarkable. They get bounced off course or get flung off entirely. It's immersive and captivating. Wave Race 64 is the complete package, and honestly, nothing has come close to hitting that exact spot or scratching that Jet Ski itch since.</p>
	<p>Not a lot of people know this, but there are options to not only rename your player but you can also select between calm, wild, and random wave conditions on difficulties you have completed. You can also unlock reverse mode (where you play every stage backwards) by coming first on expert mode, and you can even ride the dolphin in warm-up mode by pulling every trick and hitting every ring in one perfect lap.</p>

	<h4>An Incredible Showcase</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>John Hulaton lent his vocals as the announcer, who layers on even more energy and pizazz throughout the game. The feel-good arcade vibes you get every time you pick up the controller to play are exquisite, and an honourable mention has to go to the soundtrack, which also absolutely slaps. From chilled panpipes and splashy hi-hats to aggressive synth stabs and harmonica-esque leads, these aura-filled melodic earworms are in a league of their own. Don't believe me? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5JjdFqaVaw">You can check it out in its entirety here</a>.</p>
	<p><i>Wave Race 64</i> demonstrates that simplicity in its core mechanics and keeping everything else uncomplicated is the perfect move when it comes to delivering an otherwise unassuming arcade-style simulation game that is still deserving of its entry in my all-time Nintendo 64 top ten. The fact that I can jump into this any time, day or night, for hours on end is testament to its unique and enjoyable atmosphere.</p>
	<p>Imagine for a second just what this title would have looked like had it been released later in the N64's lifecycle, with support for Expansion Pak and 4 players. That is the kind of thing I dream of, but sadly it's unlikely to come via Nintendo EAD; it will come from the pioneers of the current N64 scene who have the skill and determination to maintain our beloved 64-bit games. Decomp/Recomp/Ports: I'm looking at you!</p>
	<div class="col-container">
	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Excellent replayability.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Stunning variety of levels.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Pumping synth soundtrack.<br>	
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Unlockable reverse mode.<br>	
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>The shindou edition has rumble!</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>No four-player mode.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>If I had one complaint about this game, it would be that four players cannot enjoy it together. It was made on a 4-player-enabled console, so they should have made use of it, though without the Expansion Pak, I dread to think of the frame rate.</p>
	<p>I would love to see this game put through the Recomp treatment, because if the game had HD textures, mods, high FPS, and (somehow) a four-player mode, it would be absolutely mind-blowing and we might even lay eyes on the elusive Megalodon!</p>
