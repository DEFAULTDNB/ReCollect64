	<h4>Dump and Grind</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With the dumping and releasing of the long-lost final build of Sammy's <i>Viewpoint 2064</i>, I wanted to give the latest version a spin and give you, my loyal readers, my honest opinion on this arcade-style 1999 shooter.</p>
	<p>Having played the original dump back around 2020 when it was discovered by an anonymous source, this version, found by <a href="https://hiddenpalace.org/8bitbros">8bitbros</a> in 2025, is considerably more polished and far more cinematic, so, with the assistance of the English language patch by Zoinkity (linked below) let's jump in and get blasting.</p>

	<h4>Levelling the Playingfield</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Starting out, you discover that you're a fighter pilot who seems to have had their memories wiped, fused with a ship, and plonked smack-bang in the middle of an alien invasion from the planet T3. The biggest threats are the waves of enemies, the mechanical steel insects, and the spoopy all-seeing eye boss-like enemy who seems to know something of your past.</p>
	<p>You begin in Level 01, the lost colony, and the gameplay throws you into a nice sci-fi mixture of <i>R-Type</i> meets </i>Star Fox 64</i> and even begins with a slight trolling, as it puts you into a classic Neo Geo version of Viewpoint's isometric view for the first 10 seconds, only to spin the camera around to be fully 3D and more on par with something like <i>Star Fox 64</i>'s camera view. The controller setup is nice and simple too. Sammy and Racdym didn't want to overcomplicate things so they just gave you a stick to move around, the A button to fire or hold it to lock on to up to six enemies, a wave cannon on B and a shield on R. The B and R actions only happen when you have the relevant power-ups collected.</p>
	<p>Using your ship's trusty laser cannon, you hit switches, blast baddies and collect various power-ups and accoutrements that give you slightly enhanced abilities throughout. The drip feeding of these power-ups is perfectly arcade-like, and the endorphin rush of finding something newer, with a differently shaped spread or alternately coloured beams, and more destructive is fantastic, if too few and far between for my liking.</p>
	<p>There are 15 levels to plough through in the final build, the same number as the prototype that released 5 years earlier, but each level is more polished and joined together with small cutscenes that bring the game together and make it far more coherent as a final product.</p>

	<h4>Dodging and Weaving</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Manoeuvring your ship is strange. You tilt up and down to move your ship into and out of the foreground, and you can sway left and right across the bredth of the screen to avoid enemy fire or direct your shots. While pushing towards the screen, you can move your lock-on cursor and raise it up to the top of the screen. It's exactly like a cross between the control style found in <i>Sin & Punishment</i> and <i>Star Fox 64</i>, except you cannot control the pitch (height) of your vehicle, you cannot roll, you cannot bomb and you cannot jump. It feels so overly simplified that I kept asking myself if I was missing something, but no, there is mainly just one button to fire!</p>
	<p>Holding your fire button activates a lock-on effect for your cursor, which can be waved over up to six enemies (or six points of interest) at any one time, and then upon releasing, it fires off a devastating barrage of missiles. Tackling waves of enemies is enthralling, if a little confusing at times, simply because of, ironically, the viewpoint. Because you cannot lift your fighter into the air, you have to focus on both the playing field in front of you and the skies above it. Sometimes it's counter-intuitive when you think you need to aim upwards but can only fire in a straight line in front of you, unless you use the lock-on mode to take out airborne enemies.</p>
	<p>Depth of field does play a major role with you needing to avoid attacks from above by skirting around into the foreground or rolling back closer to the camera. It's certainly an entertaining mix of dodging and shooting, especially when engaging a massively oversized insectoid boss battle. The first boss, for example, is a huge arachnid who not only fires streams of bullet-hell-like projectiles, but also rains down bombs from above and launches spinning venomous laser stingers at you which you need to navigate around to avoid it destroying your shields. Don't forget to use the R button to shield-up and absorb bullets coming from the front. It's a lifesaver!</p>

	<h4>Upgrading and Unloading</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>	<p></p>
	<p>Finishing each level, you get to choose your next stage. This means that each playthrough can have multiple variations to it, and the replayability escalates phenomenally, not to mention the high score system keeps you engaged and thirsty for more wanton massacring each time.</p>
	<p>You can go from stage 1 to stage 2 or 3, then stage 3, for example, to stage 4 or 5, and so on up to either 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15. These are the final levels for your chosen paths through the cosmos. The levels and bosses ramp up in difficulty nicely throughout, and the environments change from docile hills, forests and waterways, across decimated colonies and starbases, through to the lava-filled depths within the planet's crust. There is a nice variety of scenery to watch sail past and even more interesting enemies to destroy with your ever-altering arsenal of weapons.</p>
	<p>I really enjoyed re-playing <i>Viewpoint 2064</i>, and the final build is a huge evolution from the prototype, in that it polishes up the early version into an absolutely stellar-looking title, gels together the levels properly with more cutscenes and cements the overarching story in place. The only downside is that my hands felt like they were on fire after hammering "A" for the full hour or so of gameplay. There might actually be a case for using turbo-enabled controllers yet!</p> 
	<p>The story is a little odd, but that's typical of most games from the 90s, but regardless of this, <i>Viewpoint 2064</i> is extremely playable and very enticing to replay!</p>

	<div class="col-container">
	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>15 playable stages with banging music.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Multiple screen-filling boss battles and 5 endings!<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Full-featured design suite with documentation.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Ironically, the viewpoint can be devisive.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>My hands hurt after just 20 minutes of button bashing.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>I can't believe this game fell victim to Sammy struggling with profitability toward the end of the N64's lifespan because <i>Viewpoint 2064</i> is actually a really great shoot 'em up to play on the N64.</p>
	<p>There are far worse games that managed to release to retail that fall short of the style, pizazz and flair that this shooter contains. It has a raw arcade quality and masses of replayability, which makes this game easy to recommend to flash cart and emulation enthusiasts.</p>
