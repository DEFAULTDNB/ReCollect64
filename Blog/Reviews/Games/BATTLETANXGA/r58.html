	<h4>The Right Tracks</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Upping the ante from 1998's <i>BattleTanx</i>, 3DO brought <i>BattleTanx Global Assault</i> to more than just the Americas, with a European release for the sequel in the year 2000.</p>
	<p>In 2006, Griffin Spade, accompanied by his wife Madison and their hyper-intelligent three-year-old son Bradon, returns. Griffin is having nightmares about a Queenlord he feels he recognises from the past, and the foreboding feeling of danger is the new naff storyline for this tank-based blast-em-up.</p>
	<p>Spoiler alert, Cassandra, a psychotic megalomaniac, released the X2 virus in 2001 to kill off women without the power of Edge (some sort of female-forward ability that is criminally under-explained). Again, the story is bizarre, and if Cassandra was really sick of a patriarchal world, why kill off 99.9% of the women? Surely that's the opposite of what you would want to do?</p>

	<h4>Blastable Biomes</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>Global Assault</i> expands on the original's core pillars by bringing new teams, more tanks and fresh power-ups to play with. It also introduces spendable tank bucks and gives us new locations in Europe to explore.</p>
	<p>With nine levels, plus one secret one in the USA, and 9 more levels spread evenly across the UK, France and Germany, there are a total of 40 campaign challenges to blast through. The varied locales make <i>Global Assault</i> far more diverse in its appearance, with levels such as the Eiffel Tower, Berlin Wall, Alcatraz and the White House all containing very distinct scenery, which in turn makes for a more visually appealing game.</p>
	<p>In addition to the campaign, deathmatch, battlelord and family modes of the original, <i>Global Assault</i> adds frenzy, hold-em, tank wars and convoy modes to the mix. Frenzy has you collecting 10 Queenlords before your enemies can. Hold-em is like king of the hill, whereby you must capture a Queenlord and hold onto her for 30 seconds. Convoy is a mode where you have to protect a convoy from being destroyed between point A and point B. Lastly, Tank Wars is another deathmatch mode, but instead of first to 10, you get three minutes to rain death upon your adversaries with no kill limit; the player with the most kills is the winner.</p>
	<p>There are a few new teams to choose from too, including the Iron Maidens, Brandon's Gang, Madison's Militia, the Dark Angels, Cassandra's Forces, Shadow Ops and the Cold Forces. The only returning team is Griffin's Army, which makes sense given the protagonist is the same from the previous game.</p>
	<p>These new modes and faces definitely freshen up the formula and bring new layers of action to the staple multiplayer gaming. The main issue with the sequel is the framerate though. The game plays somewhat faster than the first, but it causes more framerate issues than the first ever had. The result is a mixture of nicer graphics combined with worse framerates, especially with four players involved. There is no Expansion Pak support either, so no chance for a little extra grunt to help the game along, though typically expansion pak enhanced games tended to increase resolution at the expense of framerate, so perhaps it is a blessing in disguise that this game doesn't support it either.</p>

	<h4>Getting Railed</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Instead of lives, <i>BattleTanx Global Assault</i> introduces tank bucks. Each level allows you to choose a tank before you begin, and there are seven to choose from. Along with the typical M1A1 Abrams, MotoTank and Goliath, there are four new additions: the Rhino, Inferno, Rattler and Annihilator tanks. The Rhino is armoured, the Inferno is a flame-thrower, the Rattler is a bigger variant of the MotoTank, and the Annihilator is a heavily armoured boss variant of the standard Goliath.</p>
	<p>Each stage allows you to purchase a tank for use in that level. Collecting points in this game finally makes sense. You accumulate points: you convert them to bucks. 10,000 points equates to ten tank bucks, which means you're purposefully trying to attain the most points possible to bolster your chances in the proceeding levels and procure bigger, more powerful tanks.</p>
	<p>The new power-ups are fun too. You now have bouncing betties, plasma bolts, teleporters, The Edge, and turbos added to the already fierce arsenal of weaponry. These all add up to more ways to flatten your surroundings and barrage the counter-forces.</p>

	<p>Having replayed Global Assault again, I have to say that the gameplay feels fresher, more inviting, and more well-rounded. A lot of the issues I had with the original are ironed out in the sequel, such as the music and SFX monotony and the campaign lacking something over the multiplayer. However, it's now flipped in terms of playability, and the single-player is far more enjoyable than the multiplayer, which was not the balance I was hoping for.</p>
	<p>I'm not sure why the game engine feels faster; it's like a frameskip has been added, and the tanks feel more twitchy to control. The trade-off of detail and pace versus framerates when under load is also consistently jarring, but it doesn't take away from an extremely playable game.</p>
	<p>Now if only someone would pick up on the cliffhanger and produce a third game in the series!</p>
	<div class="col-container">
	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Seven tanks and 19 varied levels.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>New gangs, new weapons, new characters.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Single player is now more fun than multiplayer.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>More destruction and more chaos than the first game.</div>

	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Notable graphical slowdown across all modes.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p><i>BattleTanx Global Assault</i> improves upon the original in terms of content but suffers from far more frequent slowdowns when the action gets too intense.</p>
	<p>While multiplayer is still fun, it's the single-player mode that has me most gripped in this sequel, with far more interesting and varied levels to plough through and more vehicles and weapons to choose from.</p>
