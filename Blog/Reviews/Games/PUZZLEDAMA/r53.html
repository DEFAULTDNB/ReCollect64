	<h4>Puzzling Premises</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As a sequel to <i>Tsuyoshi Shikkari Shinasai â€“ Taisen Puzzle Dama</i> (1994) for the SNES, <i>Susume! Taisen Puzzle Dama Toukon! Marutama Chou</i>, or roughly translated as <i>Advance! Battle Puzzle Balls Fighting Spirit! Marutama Town</i> (1998) is as bonkers as it looks!</p>
	<p>Konami made 18 of these games between 1994 and 2011, and this Nintendo 64 version is the 1998 port of the 1996 arcade version, <i>Susume! Taisen Puzzle-dama</i>, albeit with a couple of different characters. The story, as if anyone really cares, consists of a competition being held at Marudama village (Ball Village) with a top prize of "all you can eat at Marudama Castle". Wow.</p>
	<p>Thank goodness that regardless of the (minimal) language barrier or the weird story, this game is brilliantly competitive and wonderfully playable!</p>

	<h4>Triple Treat</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>Susume! Taisen Puzzle Dama Toukon! Marutama Chou</i>, or "Puzzle Dama" as I will refer to it, has three modes to sink your teeth into: Battle Puzzle, Battle Exchange and Bowling. Battle Puzzle pits two players against each other in a head-to-head <i>Tetris</i>-esque ball-dropping brawl, where you have to match three of the same colour together to make them disappear. Balls you vanish in combos build up as an attack of frozen balls to drop on the other player, so the first one to drown in balls loses.</p>
	<p>The smaller (frozen) square blocks take two hits, one to thaw out and then one to disappear when in a group of at least three. These sets of balls can be skilfully stacked ready to be thawed and popped in sequence to produce dazzling combos that will engulf your opposition in a sea of frozen balls. The best advice I can impart to you you is to learn your opponent's drop pattern and use that against them by stacking in the same orientation, ready to turn the tables when you catch a break or if you get handed a smiley ball, which thaws out everything they directly touch.</p>
	<p>Evil balls freeze regular balls into the frozen smaller blocks, and hungry balls will eat rows or columns of non-frozen balls, depending on their orientation. These can all be used to turn the tide, carve out some breathing space if you get in a pickle, and increase your attacks against your opponent, so use them wisely.</p>
	<p>Battle Exchange is similar, but instead of balls dropping from the sky, they surge upwards from the bottom, and you can directly swap any ball with any other ball using the cursor. This mode is more skilful because it's a race against time, plus the battle of dumping accrued balls onto your neighbour.</p>
	<p>Lastly, you can hit the lanes with a spot of bowling. This sub-game is a four-player, two-dimensional, side-on effigy of the tenpin ball sport. All you need to do is aim and fire to knock down the pins. It's simple, it's fun, and pretty much every game released in the 90s had a bowling mode.</p>
	<p>All match points are calculated according to factors such as handicap, highest combo achieved and speedy time bonuses. The game not only tracks high scores but also win/loss statistics too, if you're into all that.</p>

	<h4>Naughty Language-Barrier</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>	
	<p>Graphically, this title is extremely colourful and even has those little chibi fighting sequences in the middle of the screen, a brutal reflection of your aggressive exchanges. I particularly like that each of the thirteen characters have an increasingly wild set of animations going on behind the gameplay, depending on how well or how badly everything is going. From the gurgling of a baby, the panic-stricken weeping of a full-grown men, all the way through to an almost orgasmic-sounding nurse; the higher the combo you inflict on your adversary, the more unhinged and psychedelic the background animations become.</p>
	<p>The voices and text are all entirely in Japanese, so while you have no clue what is going on or what trash talk is being hurled, it's really easy to get to grips with for some spontaneous pick-up-and-play fun. According to magazine previews at the time, there was talk of it being all cursing and screaming, but to our European ears, we would intentionally, poorly, translate it ourselves to add to the comedy value of the frantic, panic-riddled matches. I specifically recall the Axolotl-like character used to shout, "I don't fit in the washing machine either!" You had to be there.</p>
	<p>My first memory of this title was randomly finding it on a hooky DR V64 disc once. We used to buy a 700 MB CD full of games for our DR V64s (yes, we both had one!) every few months off a guy my friend knew, and it always contained the latest games from every region. My friends and I used to play <i>Puzzle Dama</i> competitively for hours on end. Good times!</p>
	<p>The most similar game on the system is <i>Puyo Puyo Sun 64</i>, which features slimes instead of balls in a match-three environment, but personally, <i>Puzzle Dama</i> always had a more appealing energy about it. Perhaps it's the graphics, or maybe even the increasingly screaming manga girls; I don't know, but it sure is fun to play!</p>
