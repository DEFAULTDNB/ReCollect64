	<h4>First and 28</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Back in November, I reported that <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b46">NFL Blitz 2025 V2 had been released</a>. With an updated roster, jerseys, and statistics, it's a welcomed mod that makes the game feel fresh again.</p>
	<p>NFL Blitz was one of those games that nobody I knew wanted to play. It was an American sport that had very little airtime in the UK, so many of us knew nothing about it, especially as teenagers in 1997. We were either into playing Football (Soccer) or riding BMX.</p>
	<p>I remember one day playing it as a break from <i>GoldenEye</i> and <i>Mario Kart 64</i>. A friend and I gave it a go. What could be the worst, right? As it happens, we became addicted. Playing game after game between classes at every opportunity.</p>
	<p>I have many fond memories of this game, so I hope that the experience is similar to how I remember it from nearly 30 years ago!</p>

	<h4>Second Down</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Cover star Josh Hines-Allen takes the centre stage for the game's faux box art and label. As a player for the Jacksonville Jaguars since 2019, he has climbed the ranks of the NFL's top players, with the team signing him up with a five-year extension worth $150 million.</p>
	<p>According to the developers, the V2 update sees all teams (except Atlanta) reinvigorated with fresh statistics since the first version of NFL Blitz 2025 rolled out in August last year.</p>
	<p>Picking up the game, it's been a while since I last played. I have no idea why I haven't played this series for so long. Getting back into the game felt great. Everything has such an appealing arcade-like quality to it, with its bright colours, loud sound effects and crunching gameplay. The addition of fresh-feeling players really makes a difference too.</p>
	<p>I don't know if it's just me, but I felt like the game was harder to beat overall. Enhancing stats means that teams I used to be able to trounce took a few goes this time, though perhaps I was just severely rusty. Luckily, it doesn't take long to get back into NFL Blitz; it's a grippingly fast-paced yet casual sports title and far more accessible to dive into in comparison with the more simulation-driven <i>NFL Quarterback Club</i> games.</p>

	<h4>Field Goals</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>	
	<p>As far as I can tell, no major additions have been made to this game past the <i>NFL Blitz 2000</i> base this mod was built upon. No new moves, stadiums, animations or models, just pure, unadulterated statistics, emblems, kit recolouring, and jersey numbering.</p>
	<p>There are still 31 teams, but 2025 V2 has Houston, Las Vegas & the L.A. Chargers added, but Oakland (now Las Vegas Raiders), San Diego (now L.A. Chargers), and St. Louis have been removed or altered to best reflect the 2025 season changes. The game already had a built-in play editor, which also remains untouched, but you can alter your plays and make some exciting new manoeuvres that you can pin-code lock behind your save game.</p>
	<p>Controlling the game could not be simpler. The A and B buttons, plus the stick and trigger are pertty much all you need to get you hammering around. I love the pick-up-and-play aspect of this game, with its over the top violent smashes and ability to turn the tide of game on a dime.</p>
	<p>Starting out, you may get sacked to hell, but this is where you learn to deploy tactics and make plays that gain you ground. For those unnaware, American Football is like Rugby on steroids. The gameplay principles are the same, except you pass forwards instead of backwards.</p>

	<p>Most of the gameplay comes from your ability to navigate the field. If you put in a few yards to develop your timing and finesse, you will go far, but if you fail to get your ideas in order, you will fumble and turn over very quickly. It's best to learn when to jump/hurdle, when to spin/stiff arm, and when to dash using that turbo button, because timing is everything, and you don't want to run out of steam before you hit that end zone.</p>
	<p>Though the teams and loading screens have been updated, it would have been great to see some further graphical changes. I would have liked to see some new animations, or new stadiums, or perhaps a new selection of plays in the playbook pages. It's not that the game needs these touches; it would only really push the game further into an all-out full game mod.</p>
	<p>Playing through a couple of arcade matches, I really enjoyed every moment. This game is better than NFL Blitz 2000 purely because it's even more aesthetically pleasing and slightly tougher to bounce through. I highly recommend finding a player 2 to play with you at the very least, because this game is great as a single-player jaunt but stunning as a two-player competitive smash.</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Updated teams.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Updated player stats.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Incredibly fun to play.<br>

	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Should be distributed as a patch.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>The NFL Blitz Resurrection team has done a stellar job of updating the roster and making the game feel fresh and vibrant for 2025. I legitimately forgot just how fun and addictive this game is, so I highly recommend you give this one a look!</p>
	<p>Though I cannot link to the ROM, it's not difficult to obtain. I wish the game was distributed as a *.BPS patch instead. Also, please do not pay for this on a £40 repro cartridge, the developers see none of that money, so please download and play for free via emulation or a flashcart.</p>
