	<h4>Nostalgic Notes</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Kurko Mods is back with a continuation of his smash hit mod, Stay at Home, that takes everything you thought you knew about game overhauls and turns it on its head.</p>
	<p>With a similar theme to Team Asobi's <i>Astros Playroom</i> game for PS5, <i>Banjo-Kazooie: Nostalgia 64</i>, aka BK: N64, plants you within the internal technical gubbins of an N64, with you in charge of discovering the secrets that lie within.</p>

	<p>The dichotomy of reviewing games or mods that people haven't played yet is the balance of giving facts and information versus spoiling any secrets and incredible findings I might have stumbled upon.</p>
	<p>My preferred method is to deliver a small warning that anything from here on in may contain spoilers, though I am not going to post any screenshots of anything further than the opening sections so that you get to experience the majesty and awe of the visuals for yourself.</p>
	<p>I you don't so much as want to hear any of the details featured in this modification, then please feel free to skip to the scores below for a quick summary of the game without giving too much away (I hope).</p>
	<h4>**SPOILERS AHEAD**</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Upon beginning the game, you meet Syx T. Ford, a king-like being that resides within your Nintendo 64 console. He explains that the land has become corrupted and unstable, so it's up to the venerated Bear and Bird to investigate and figure out what's going on. From the opening scenes to the glib exchanges, Kurko and Bynine have injected Banjo and Kazooie with authentic character, and their attitudes and nuances really shine through the vast and brilliant script.</p>
	<p>Jumping on a flight pad, you soar into a room daubed with the aggressively classic "Get N or Get out!" Nintendo 64 marketing slogan, and a giant console is set up with a controller, ready to explore. Jumping into the cartridge, you begin your quest. The main hub area, known as Sixty-Four Square, is your first taste of technical exploration. There are pathways made of circuit boards, and ribbon wires. The chipsets on the floor indicate both the name of the game you're heading towards as well as actual components of the N64's internal workings. This mod isn't just a brilliant game; it's an education!</p>
	<p>The aim of the game is to collect notes to unlock new areas, rescue Jinjos and collect Jiggies. 64 Jiggies offered to the podium will unlock the last door, but what lies behind that, you might ask? Of course there is a boss fight, but also more nostalgia - an overload of incredible nostalgia! That's all I'm saying.</p>
	<p>One thing I found incredibly captivating from the beginning are the cameos. Character after character, chiming in with the trademark jibberish voice sounds, throwing shade and making witty remarks; it's incredible. Characters from a multitude of franchises and consoles too. There are too many to list in full, but you'll hear from LayLee, Gruntilda, Sonic the Hedgehog and Metal Gear Solid's General Roy Campbell, to name but a few. Of course he screams "Banjooooooooooooooo" when you die!</p>

	<h4>Oozing Quality</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The story unfolds to explain that it is in fact Bottles that needs stopping! It's the hapless, dirt-covered mole playing out his villainous arc in this story, corrupting the innards of your console, so it's up to you to save the day before he takes over the console and the neighbouring star systems!</p>
	<p>Sixty-Four Square contains two games: <i>Yoshi's Story</i>, which is somewhat of a two-dimensional side-scrolling tutorial level with honeycombs to collect and Mumbo tokens to find, and <i>Super Mario 64</i>, which has not one but THREE gorgeous levels from the plumber's platformer, faithfully recreated in the Banjo-Kazooie world. You have Bomb-omb Battlefield, Whomp's Fortress and Jolly Roger Bay paintings to jump through. Each one has a selection of Jiggies and Jinjos to find, minigames to complete, as well as those saught-after notes!</p>
	<p>These two levels alone are extremely impressive, but it's only a mere taste of things to come, as heading left to the CPU area, you need 200 notes to gain access to Ultra Ocean, an area that contains <i>Bomberman 64</i>, <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i> and </i>GoldenEye 007</i>, and heading to the right, you have to accrue 500 notes to get through to Expansion City, where you'll find levels from <i>Donkey Kong 64</i>, <i>Conker's Bad Fur Day</i> and <i>Pokemon Snap</i>!</p>
	<p><i>Bomberman 64</i> features a fully explorable Blue Resort, as well as some top-down mazes to get stuck into. The transition from 3D to top-down is great, and you know exactly what you're doing. <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i> features an explorable town which looks like Greenwood Village and the interior of Banjo's house was designed by JMGO following a contests held on Twitch by Kurko Mods in 2021 (as a side note, Burgozack designed the interior of Diddy's house after winning a Kurko contest too!). You can also find a little SNES bonus level here from <i>Donkey Kong Country 2</i>, Mainbrace Mayhem, which plays out in 2D with the memorable fog effects and everything!</p>
	<p><i>Goldeneye 007 is one of my faves, and playing through the Arkhangelsk dam level is an absolute blast. Without going too in-depth, you get to bungee-jump off and enter none other than the facility! I couldn't believe it, the first two levels of <i>GoldenEye 007</i> are faithfully recreated within this mod, and they're pretty tough! Before you ask, yes, there are the secrets you would hope to find in GoldenEye's opening level, and yes, there are plenty of Easter eggs to find, including a <i>Battletoads</i> reference! At this point, barely halfway into the ROM hack, I'm totally convinced that nothing is impossible for Mark Kurko to put into </i>Banjo-Kazooie</i>!</p>
	<p>I won't go into too much detail about <i>Conker's Bad Fur Day, Donkey Kong 64, Pokemon Snap</i> or any additional games (yes, there are several more!), because these are further into the story and contain a boatload of goodies, references, levels and things to explore! I will just say that each one is more ingenious and (believe it or not) nostalgic than the last.</p>

	<h4>A Monumantal Masterpiece</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>	
	<p>With assets created from scratch and a plethora of reference materials scattered across every surface, this game hits you in the feels from all directions. The textures, layout, and feel of each game are captured so well that you have to continuously remind yourself that this is a modification of a different game altogether. It's all done so intelligently that it's a pleasure to behold.</p>
	<p>The music throughout is stunning. Renditions of each area's recognisable themes are reworked into the <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> soundfont to give the game yet another layer of polish. Hearing GoldenEye's music in the game was nothing short of mindblowing. Credit where credit's due; this game is phenomenal in every department.</p>
	<p>The game is fully compatible with every emulator I tested for PC, Android and iOS and I can confirm that it also works perfectly on my Everdrive 64 X7 and SummerCart64 flashcarts, so there is no reason not to enjoy this game wherever you find yourself with a penchant to dive into the nostalgic vibes of this game.</p>
	<p>There are a couple of small glitches and GFX oddities, but nothing that I found was game-breaking; at least nothing was so absurd that it didn't make sense, if that makes sense? Modders should look to this for inspiration. Sure, it's been years in the making, but the wait has been more than worth it!</p>
	<div class="col-container">

	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p><i>Banjo-Kazooie: Nostalgia 64</i> is one of those rare moments where you cannot believe what you're seeing. From the sheer range of references, the facts and the music, you will fall in love with this game's utterly enjoyable and highly explorative vibes from start to finish. I found it quite tough throughout, but it's a charming and fantastic journey that is worth battling through, trust me.</p>
	<p>Markus Kurko has thoroughly excelled himself; the amount of effort that has gone into this is absolutely mind-blowing. I would go as far as to say that this overhaul raises the bar significantly on any mods that have come before it; it's professional-level modding at its finest!</p>
	<p>Early access for <a href="https://www.patreon.com/Kurko">Patreons</a> begins today (May 7th), and general release is slated for May 17th, so clear your diaries!</p>
