	<h4>DMA Journey</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Set in 2016, this 1998 third-person shooter was brought to us by Scotland-based studio DMA Design and raised the bar for open-world exploration on Nintendo's latest home console by merging role-playing elements, driving, flying and shooting into one explosive package. It almost didn't make it to the console after Nintendo refused to publish it; thankfully Midway & Gremlin Entertainment picked it up in the eleventh hour.</p>
	<p>That unassuming little Scottish studio is today part of Rockstar North, known for groundbreaking titles such as <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> and <i>Manhunt</i>. The only other release they would have on the 64-bit system was <i>Space Station Silicon Valley</i>, another game that pushed the envelope with body-jumping mechanics, exploring novel and interesting ideas for the late 90s.</p>

	<h4>Starship Troopers</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Body Harvest</i> is a game I have a personal love-hate relationship with. On one hand, it's brilliant with huge, sprawling, explorative elements. On the other hand, it's buggy, no pun intended, but the game suffers from poor framerates and, at times, game-breaking collision detection.</p>
	<p>The main protagonist, Adam Drake, is an orange-armour-clad genetically enhanced super soldier of a similar ilk to <i>Halo</i>'s Master Chief. The main crux of the game is to prevent the alien invaders from harvesting the humans of Earth across five time periods. You must explore the scenery, assist civilians, avoid accidentally squishing them, and complete a series of light puzzles and POI-based fetch quests.</p>
	<p>The story goes that the aliens return every 25 years to imprison civilians within the dome-like shields and harvest them for energy. The various time periods you'll bounce around are Greece 1916, Java 1941, America 1966, Siberia 1991, and finally the Alien Comet in 2016. These provide a nice selection of environments and biomes to discover.</p>
	<p>Throughout the game you are bombarded with messages from Flt Cmdr Daisy Hernandez, your 24/7 overwatch. She litters your display with information and tips, but I found it quite overwhelming to have constant updates and directions given. The missions are simple, but sometimes it forces you to trudge back to another area to get a specific vehicle needed for a specific mission. This wouldn't be half as bad if these missions weren't against the clock, because if you don't know your way around, you will get lost, and you will run out of time.</p>
	<p>Failing missions is not the be-all and end-all. As long as you don't fail too many or accidentally kill excessive numbers of civilians while exploring, you can avoid mega mutant aliens from spawning. Yes, the penalty for killing the aliens prey yourself is more death to humans!</p>
	<p>I like the mood of the game; it has a real apocalyptic atmosphere and a galactic-scale feel to it. The aliens crumble and explode pleasingly, and the auto-aiming gun action reminds me of <i>Jet Force Gemini's</i> wave shooting mechanics. I would have liked to see more random encounters, as most seem to be triggered in certain zones, and they never spawn again, making the game feel even more sparse once you have cleared the surrounding areas.</p>

	<h4>Buggin Hunt</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>	
	<p>I found that I was constantly consulting the map to figure out where I was and which direction to head in next. Though you have a vague directional indicator, you cannot set your own waypoints, nor display a trail to follow to get you to your destination. This game was so ahead of its time, but it's hard to go back to it now without missing more modern gameplay conveniences. That's not to say it is impossible; it's just very time-consuming to scour the entire map and trek back and forth between locations for items and tasks.</p>
	<p>I wouldn't say that <i>Body Harvest</i> was a casual game. It can be quite intense trying to find your way and find items, but ultimately the game is a series of rescues and fetch quests with bug blasting in between. The puzzle aspect involves you finding something, like a component or a specific weapon, to further your progress towards an Alien Processor. Having done that, the next stop is destroying a shield generator and vanquishing a boss, typically with a vehicle. Rinse and repeat.</p>
	<p>I have to admit the level of interactivity throughout is astonishing. There are books and signs to read, NPCs to talk to, and even silly things like pressing interact on a human skeleton leads to a Skeletor-esque evil laugh. I love little touches like this, it demonstrates that the developers had a great time producing this title. They did it all in just two years too!</p>
	<p>Balancing tasks, reading your meters to ensure you haven't killed too many civilians and vanquishing the boss-like alien processors is challenging. Downing the bosses opens up the next area of the map and allows you to progress, removing the entire shield from segmenting the map. No spoilers, but even after smashing the Alien Comet, the endgame gives you an awesome amount more time-hopping blasting to do.</p>
	<p>Another noteworthy mechanic is the vehicle petrol gauge. If you find yourself a robust armoured tank, armed to the teeth, do not expect it to last forever. As you travel, you use petrol. Run out of gas, and you're on foot from here on out (unless you have a stash of nitro) and with far less fire-power than you initially set out with. There are around 37 vehicles to discover in the game, which is mind-blowing for a 3D game from 1998. For reference, the original <i>GTA</i> from 1997 had 59, and <i>GTA 2</i> from 1999 had 69 2D vehicles. 3D vehicles wouldn't come until 2001 in <i>GTA 3</i>, where you had access to 56 of them to romp around in.</p>

	<h4>Ahead of its Time</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The game cleverly utilised Gouraud shading, fog and vortex lightmaps, and full motion movement to give the game its unique look. I particularly like the little details, like the gradient skies, flames that glow in the darker areas and the shadows that loom over you when being attacked from above. The battle mechanics are also extremely well implemented too, with a brilliant lock-on targeting system and strafing while firing allowing you to live the action.</p>
	<p>If we boil <i>Body Harvest</i> down to its core ingredients, we have arcade-style bug blasting across huge maps, massive bosses to take down, RPG elements like NPCs to talk to, buildings with interiors, fuel-consuming drivable tanks, choppers, bikes, boats with fuel consumption systems and so much more. <i>Body Harvest</i> achieves a lot of technical feats and mechanics in one game, but it comes with a couple of caveats.</p>
	<p>Because there is so much going on here, the framerates and collision are extremely questionable. The expansion pak is not compatible, so the game relies on 304×230 upscaled to 320x240, which results in blurry visuals that run slightly quicker than if they were natively 320x240. The frame count is spiky, with a generally slow feel to the entire game, which is additionally impacted by masses of aliens, explosions, and flying bullets being onscreen at any one time.</p>
	<p>Ultimately, if you can forgive the janky flow of the game, and the paltry handful of weapons, you will uncover an enjoyable action-adventure game that takes a good 10-15 hours to complete, or longer if you go off-piste looking for everything that is hidden in the game.</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Non-linear open-world with bosses.<br>

	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>Body Harvest is an incredible title with core gameplay pillars akin to a proto-GTA title. Had the game been given just another layer of polish, it would have been absolutely killer, but as it stands, it is technically fantastic but marred by the technology of its age.</p>
	<p>It would have been great to see a sequel on the GameCube with full FMV cutscenes; however, waning sales never allowed the title to become more than a firm fan/cult favourite between those who know about it.</p>
