	<h4>Aging Like Fine Wine</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With the turning of the Nintendo 64's 29th revolution around the Sun, it's only fitting to mark my 64th review with the game that kicked off the 64-bit console in Japan on June 23rd, 1996!</p>
	<p>Princess Toadstool, Peach, has baked a cake for Mario, and so he's excited to check it out. The only thing is that the despicably predictable Bowser has kidnapped the princess, hiding her away in the castle behind locked doors and painting portals to explorable worlds.</p>
	<p>Entering each painting allows you to gather stars, and the stars unlock new areas of the castle, eventually leading to the ultimate one-on-one face-off with the dragon-like king of the koopas.</p>
	<p>Though I didn't get this game until it came out in Europe in March of 1997, I was fully aware of the plumber's next outing thanks to various N64 magazines and TV shows, such as Games Master, hyping it up for me. The second I got my hands on the console, I also got a copy of <i>Super Mario 64</i>, which was an exciting start to an era that I will never forget.</p>

	<h4>Perilous Paintings</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Even before you enter the castle, there is a sandbox feel to the game. You can explore, run, jump and acrobatically reach new areas as you wish. You are given freedom but also direction. As a door opens, you're led through the labyrinth of areas and floors, hoping to rescue the princess as swiftly as possible but at the same time, never wanting this experience to end.</p>
	<p>Throughout the 15 worlds you explore, you collect coins for power, mushrooms for lives, and stars and keys for unlocking the doors of the castle. Each world is varied and fresh, demonstrating the power of the 64-bit hardware and putting you through various courses with puzzles, trials and items to collect, with zero loading times!</p>

	<p>The worlds include Bob-omb Battlefield, Whomp's Fortress, Jolly Roger Bay, Cool, Cool Mountain, Big Boo's Haunt, Hazy Maze Cave, Lethal Lava Land, Shifting Sand Land, Dire Dire Docks, Snowman's Land, Wet-dry World, Tall, Tall Mountain, Tiny-huge Island, Tick Tock Clock and Rainbow Ride. You have water, sand, air, lava, snow and perspective-shifting locations within clocks, pyramids, mountains and clouds.</p>
	<p>My personal favourite levels are Bob-Omb Battlefield and Jolly Roger Bay, as these serve as iconic levels that introduce you to platforming and swimming in three dimensions. This was the first time we had a camera to control, 360 degrees of freedom, so it was a massive adventure to not only investigate the lands but also learn our way around the beautifully unique NUS-005 N64 controller.</p>
	<p>One moment you're scaling the heights searching for red coins; the next you're slipping and sliding down paths as fast as possible against a penguin. The sheer variety of tasks and environments blew our brains in the late 90s, and it felt like there was no limit to the hours you could put in to find every single coin and star. You can see exactly why this title ushered in the "collect-a-thon" genre and directly inspired games such as <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> and <i>Spyro the Dragon</i> over on Sony's 32-bit console</p>

	<h4>Controller Creativity</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As we know, SM64 was designed around the N64 controller. Developed in tandem, the controller influenced the game's mechanics, and the game refined what was required of the console's input mechanisms. The end result was an "M"-shaped, three-pronged pad that had the critics of the time convinced it was built by aliens. The shoulder buttons were a step up from the SNES's ones, with far more ergonomic shaping and comfortability. The A and B buttons were now joined by the C-Buttons, aptly progressing up the alphabet but also reminding us that "C" stands for Camera, and allowing us to be the director, setting our own perspective every time we played.</p>
	<p>The centralised start button was now alone, without a select button companion, but it was bigger and redder, like an emergency stop button to pause play. At the very back was a Z trigger, giving you the sensation of wielding a gun which, of course, Nintendo didn't exactly intend with its family-friendly system, but it was handy because the N64 would go on to pioneer some of the best first-person shooters of the era that still influence games today. Nintendo knew exactly what they were doing.</p>
	<p>I'm still convinced that even the latest competitors controllers are distant descendants of the N64 controller, sharing the DNA of the outer handle ergonomics and one central button to take us back to the main menu. All that's missing is the middle prong!</p>
	<p>I have always appreciated just how smooth Mario's kinetic motion is within Super Mario 64. Vaulting around, turning on a dime, and flipping, sliding and wall-jumping were made so effortless with the controller in hand, and set the tone for the proceeding Super Mario games that would follow SM64's legacy and evolve in their own ways.</p>

	<h4>Graphical Greatness</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>	
	<p>Flying, racing, surfing, sliding, bouncing, falling and leaping are all fully catered for across the Mushroom Kingdom, with each level teaching you a new move and drilling it in before you reach the boss. Battling Thwomp teaches you the ground pound, grappling King Bob-Omb teaches you how to grab and throw, and facing off with Bowser teaches you how to use the analogue stick to spin and chuck that lizard into bombs. Nintendo has a clever ethos of pairing input teaching with gameplay mechanics, and it pays off by the end of the game, where you need to put all your skills into practice before taking on Bowser for the third and final time.</p>
	<p>The levels become progressively more challenging, with the latter ones pushing your abilities and stretching your power bar to the max. The best strategy is to try to find as many coins as you can to increase your life count in the early stages to best prep you for the more taxing levels like Lethal Lava Land and Rainbow Ride. It can be a little frustrating when you're constantly falling into liquid magma or plummetting to your death from the clouds, but practise makes perfect, and if all else fails, try another approach. Regardless of your ability, SM64 caters for all ages and dexterities, which makes this game a perfect all rounder for any one to play regardless of their skillset when it comes to platforming.</p>
	<p>Though technically the game appears primitive (let's remember it's 29 years old today, and doesn't even support rumble or expansion paks), and exhibits a lot of basic behaviours, mechanics and physics, they're all tied together so neatly and all work so succinctly thanks to the Reality Coprocessor's ability to simulate these things that the game is a resoundingly slick and positive experience throughout. Mario's animations are so wistful, playful and expressive; the levels all demonstrate a semi-open world traits long before that was a thing, and effects such as flames, liquids, metals, and transparent clouds all culminate in a cartoony but believable world.</p>

	<h4>Sound Design</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>	
	<p>Not only is the underlying game design exceptional, but the sound design in this game is phenomenal too. Each world has a catchy earworm theme song, and each character and NPC has a selection of sound effects that trigger as and when required. Coin sounds are updated from the SNES and NES era typicals, but the ring of a 1-up is unmistakable. This is truly the evolution of Mario that fans deserved, a technical marvel that expands on the Mario universe and retains some of what made it so great to play and so iconic so consume in the first place.</p>
	<p>With the addition of RPG-like elements as opposed to A-B sidescrolling, means that characters become more fleshed out, there is an undulating storyling that is deviated from and directed back towards, all the way through. Even without full voice acting, the main baddies and our hero have so much personality that draws you into the game and leaves you wanting to play more!</p>
	<p>Today you can enjoy <i>Super Mario 64</i> on over <a href="https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Super_Mario_64_port">15 alternative platforms</a> thanks to the work of the <a href="https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64">decompilation project</a> and the community of fans willing to put the effort into getting it working on each one. You can also play the beta recreation, online multiplayer mods, apply quality of life updates, play at 120 FPS in ultra widescreen and even swap characters thanks to modding of the source code!</p>
