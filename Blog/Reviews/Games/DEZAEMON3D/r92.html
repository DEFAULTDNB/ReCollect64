	<h4>Create and Destroy</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>In 1998, Nintendo really wanted to push the creative limits of their consumers by giving them games and hardware that would satiate the need to customise and craft content. With the Nintendo 64DD around the corner and a planned mouse peripheral on the way, <i>Dezaemon 3D</i> was designed to be an editable shoot 'em up with expandable features and player ease-of-use at the forefront.</p>
	<p>While Athena's <i>Dezaemon 3D</i> did release in 1998, the Nintendo 64 Disk Drive didn't see a release outside of Japan and was discontinued a little over a year later. <i>Dezaemon 3D</i> still has that feel of being a 64DD-compatible title, but how does it play, and does still it allow for creativity based on its sadly restricted lifecycle?</p>

	<h4>Shooting Stars</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>If you think of <i>Dezaemon 3D</i> as a shoot 'em up first and creative tools second, you're short-changing the nature of the game. This suite of design tools, which encompasses sprite, model, music and level editors, is so much more than a mere additional bolt-on. These editors are the heart of the game, though they are often painfully overlooked because of two factors: firstly the language barrier, and secondly, the complexity of the tools at hand.</p>
	<p>Sure, the game contains two fully playable example games, <i>Solid Gear</i> and <i>USAGI-san</i> (and one secret game called RAMSIE too), but the core draw for this title is within its creative freedom and ability for you to craft anything your mind can fathom.</p>
	<p>Where <i>Solid Gear</i> is a raw demonstration of the power of the engine's ability to render multiple players, enemies, dialogue and cut scenes within a vertical scrolling format, <i>USAGI-san</i> is a quirky, cartoony variation on the formula, which blends vertical with horizontal levels and throws in a heady mixture of themes and brilliantly animated chaos.</p>
	<p>All of the included games are fantastic to play, and I really enjoyed the futuristic and realistic visuals of <i>Solid Gear</i> and the almost cell-shaded toon aesthetic of the rabbit-themed game. Each game is fun, frantic and extremely playable, but each only lasts around 20-30 minutes, so they're relatively short-lived.</p>
	<p><center>(Note: to unlock <i>RAMSIE</i>, to to the game menu, place your cursor on the cartridge icon and tap: <b>C-Up, C-Down, C-Left, C-Right, C-Down, C-Down, C-Up, C-Up</b>).</center></p>

	<h4>Constructive Critique</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Prior to the English language patch, users in the western hemisphere would have had to use elaborate methods to translate the dictionary-like plethora of instructions and tutorials required to get a grasp on the editors. Thankfully, today we can simply apply a patch and play the game in our native tongue, but that doesn't stop this construction kit from having a reasonably high barrier to entry. You'll simply need persistent creative vision and unwaivering determination to complete a fully fleshed-out overhaul that you can call your own, but be warned, it's not a 5 minute process, you will be tinkering for days!</p>
	<p>Each editor comes with step-by-step tutorials for every stage in the process, so there is instantly a rather steep learning curve for getting the most out of the creative side of this title. However, if you're willing to put in the time, you can create your very own niche game with the polish and precision of a professional. Playing <i>USAGI-san</i> made me want to fashion a <i>Dolphin Blue</i>-esque title, where you transition from land to sea across horizontal levels, but my abilities are extremely limited, and I failed to make anything coherent or playable because the analogue stick, in my opinion, is not ideal for drawing or modelling precision.</p>
	<p>Sadly, yet understandably, the game only allows for a certain number of assets to be created per level, only 5 levels can be made per game, and only one game can be saved per cartridge. These limitations, while frustrating, clearly convey the scope of what the Nintendo 64DD's ability to write to multiple disks would have held. With more storage, you could have more levels and even work on multiple games and ideas at the same time.</p>
	<p>Along with the hidden game <i>RAMSIE</i> and the ill-fated 64DD support, there is another feature that was discovered recently. <a href="https://tcrf.net/Dezaemon_3D#The_Hidden_Sample_Game_RAMSIE">Fileserver I/O</a> was discovered within <i>Dezaemon 3D's</i> code, and with another unlock code involving the C buttons, the functionality to connect to a PC was included with the main intention of debugging and testing. Perhaps this could also be used to expand the game and share custom levels?</p>

	<h4>Dezaemon-ised Design</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>	<p></p>
	<p>In the right hands, I could see this game being the ultimate creativity suite. There are so many editables throughout each layer of this onion-like experience that it's impossible not to be impressed with the freedom you have at your fingertips. Sadly for me, I don't have the time or the attention span to cope with pouring hundreds of hours into crafting something overly ambitious, so my limits were confined within the realms of modifying textures and composing simple musical melodies.</p>
	<p>While the scope of this game was enormous, I feel that Dezaemon 3D never got the audience it deserved and so never fully realised its ambitious intentions across a big enough player base. Back in 1998 especially, this would have blown my mind wide open and would probably have spurred me on to do more game design as a teenager, but sadly, it never made it to my shores. I don't think I even really knew about the existence of this game until about 15 years ago, when I began seriously collecting Nintendo 64 carts again, and I only came to own this game in July 2023.</p>

	<div class="col-container">
	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Three solid 3D shooters and an editor.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Addictive arcade look and feel.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Full-featured design suite with documentation.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Bold bosses and a secret game to unlock.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Difficult to draw and edit with a control stick.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Construction is limited to just 5 levels.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>With no 64DD expansion, you can only build one game at a time.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Relatively short gameplay loop, and pre-built games are easy to complete.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>As long as you are creative and inspired, you can make some incredible levels and vehicles, plus the accompanying music to go with it. Should you only buy this to play the included games, you'll have a great but short-lived time, though you will not get the true 1998 Nintendo 64-era experience and will lose a lot of the intention behind the title.</p>
	<p>I would have much preferred to control all of this with a mouse, because the control stick is finicky. Thanks to Whowasphone404 and Zoinkity for the English translation patch too, without that I would never have been able to understand or experience the freedom and brilliance that exists within <i>Dezaemon 3D</i>, beyond the baked-in games.</p>
