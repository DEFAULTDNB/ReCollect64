	<h4>Animated Action</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Disney has always pushed the boat out when it comes to producing beautifully animated films and games, and Activision and Disney Interactive's work on Tarzan for the N64 is no different.</p>
	<p>Until recently, I don't think I had ever played this game on the N64, probably because I wasn't a huge Disney fan, and the game looked very childlike from the get-go. I vaguely know the story of Tarzan from books as a child, so I'm not going in completely cold, but it wasn't my favourite growing up.</p>
	<p>If you're asking, <i>The Emperor's New Groove</i> (2000) was one of the only Walt Disney animations I remember enjoying, but I definitely don't remember watching Disney's 1999 Tarzan movie either.</p>

	<h4>HEY, TERK!</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Oddly, the game begins immediately, and there is no preamble at all as to who you are or why you are where you are. To enjoy the story, you must enter the "Character Screens" section before even beginning the game, which was unclear. I would have hoped that the game would have automatically delivered some backstory and let me get into the groove of the underlying tale.</p>
	<p>Instead, you jump into your first level, a tutorial level, whereby you learn to shout "Hey, Terk!" and learn how to play every 30 seconds, chuck fruit at animals and collect bucketloads of coins.</p>
	<p>There are thirteen main levels in this game, and each one contains 100 coins, a sketch split into four pieces, fruit for energy, and a yellow umbrella to mark the end goal. Again, a little explanation would go a long way, I just accepted the quirks and moved on.</p>
	<p>Collecting 100 coins gives you an extra life, four pieces of the sketch lets you play a short coin-filled bonus level, and collecting the letters T, A, R, Z, E and N bags you story screens, so you can catch up on whatever the heck you've been doing in the jungle all this time anyway.</p>

	<h4>Flinging Fruit</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The game is essentially a 2D/3D platformer which primarily flows left to right, from start to finish. I was a little amazed to see the game's camera pan, zoom and swoop around your character as he clambers up perilous rock formations or swings through the tree canopies. Some angles put you behind Tarzan as he slides down branches, avoiding hazards and collecting coins, whereas others, like the Stampede level, put the camera in front, and you run towards the camera. It's more dynamic and visually interesting, but at points it's very hard to see the route ahead.</p>
	<p>The levels aren't particularly varied either, with a minimal background/skybox change on each level. It's 99% jungle, which is fair enough, because it's set in a jungle, but there are very few moments where you say to yourself, "Wow that was particularly interesting or vibrant." It's almost all mud and leaves. The character and NPC animation is superb, and the artistic style of the game is on point throughout, matching its big-screen incarnation. Each character moves fluidly, and the flow of the game can be quite enthralling when you're blitzing through the foliage and sliding through trunks. Alas, there are no bonuses for speedrunning the game, just collecting everything in sight.</p>
	<p>I found the irony of stabbing to death monkeys, lemurs, rhinos, frogs, birds of prey and other mammals along your journey quite bizarre. All these animals seem to be out to hurt you and prevent you from progressing, yet isn't one of the underlying threads of the story about man's destructive nature, hunting animals and destroying the environment? You either need to avoid them, which I preferred, throw various bits of fruit, or thrash about with a primitive-looking dagger until they explode into a cloud of psychedelic butterflies. Sure, makes sense.</p>

	<h4>A Short Story</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>For a game based on a movie, it doesn't openly bring across many story beats, and worst of all, when it does, it's done via storyboard images with text, rather than movie clips. The reason for this is obvious: the N64 cartridges couldn't fit all those gorgeous animations in, so Activision cut them in favour of stills.</p>
	<p>The voicing, sound effects and music throughout are actually great. Where they cut down on FMV to save space, they have crammed in plenty of voice recordings and animal sounds to capture the atmosphere and environments. If Tarzan wasn't so repetitive in his iconic howling shrieks, it would have been a bit more pleasant to play, but overall it's quite impressive for a 16 MB N64 game to have so much audio.</p>
	<p>Time-wise, Tarzan only lasts around two hours across its 13 main levels, one super-basic boss fight against Clayton, in which you need to duck under his super-dumb shotgun blasts and avoid throwing knives, and a couple of bonus levels which have you swimming, flying or swinging for coins. By level 5 you become an adult, but the gameplay remains pretty much the same; it just gets a little more tricky.</p>
	<p>The repetition of jumping, avoiding, and swinging becomes monotonous very quickly. The gameplay can pick up pace in places, but it's certainly reminiscent of the 2D SNES <i>The Lion King</i> or <i>Aladdin</i> games, which, don't get me wrong, were tough as nails, but I didn't find these games anywhere near as by-the-numbers to get through.</p>
