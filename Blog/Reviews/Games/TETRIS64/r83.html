	<h4>A Cultural Classic</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>Tetris 64</i> is Seta's 1998 version of 1985's original Tetris game by Pajitnov. Featuring Tetris, Giga Tetris and Bio Tetris, this Japanese exclusive cemented itself in the annals of history as being the only game to use the Bio Sensor clip-on accessory that alters the game's speed and piece selection based on the player's heart rate.</p>
	<p>As a regular player of the OG Tetris on the Game Boy back in the late 80s, I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with the game. In replaying it today with a 64-bit makeover, will I find an invigorated love for the game, or will I find fresh ways to get frustrated?</p>

	<h4>Triple Trouble Tetrominoes</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>Tetris 64</i> features just three gameplay modes, three game modes (a, b, or c), four types of music (Warner, CD-Wood, Five-Q, and Street), and you can alter the width of the standard 10 block-width playing area in some modes from 8 to 20 to really shake up the action.</p>
	<p>Regular Tetris plays just as you would imagine, with the classic gameplay at your fingertips with a vibrant facade of coloured pieces and rather strange stock images in the background. I'm not sure of the exact relevance of the images; perhaps they're scenes from Russia, the birthplace of Tetris.</p>
	<p>Giga Tetris is a rather interesting beast. With oversized blocks you get hemmed in quite quickly, but the flip side is that the big blocks break down into smaller pieces which fall down gravitationally compared to the small block pieces which can mount up suspended in mid-air. The result is some really cool combos of blocks breaking and falling, slotting into the garbage pile below to clear some more of the field.</p>

	</center>
	<p>Lastly, there is Bio Tetris, which is extremely niche and ultimately underwhelming. Plugging the Bio Sensor (which does not come with the game as standard) into the controller's pak socket, you clip the device to your ear, and the game detects your resting heartbeat. This entire mode adds a visual output of your pulse on the lefthand side, with a glowing, throbbing heart showing your sinus rhythm increasing or decreasing depending on your stress levels. The pieces in play are very odd too, with the traditionally 4-piece tetrominoes diverging into 2, 3, and 5-block pieces at times too.</p>
	<p>This final mode is very hit and miss, and it honestly doesn't feel like it does much; just the pieces that appear are altered depending on your pulse, with harder parts coming when you get hot and bothered. This could have just been added in as another RNG function because it's so minor, but to be fair, the sensor legitimately detects and utilises the player's pulse, which is interesting.</p>
	<p>As an owner of the sensor, this is the only game that uses it, and it's disappointing. I wish they had used this peripheral for more than one title, but conversely, would any other games that utilise this technology have been any good? I have my doubts.</p>
	<p>On a final note, Tetris and Giga Tetris are split into A, B and C modes. Mode A is a marathon mode, mode B is done in stages, and mode C is like mode A but with the addition of garbage blocks that creep up the area, lifting your play space towards the ceiling.</p>

	<h4>Another Brick in The Wall</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Am I a fan of Tetris? Yes. Am I a fan of <i>Tetris 64</i>? I'm not convinced. The gameplay is as you would expect. In fact, it plays nearly identically to that of its Game Boy counterpart, but barring Giga Tetris, the additional modes and colours don't bring anything new to the table. It's like Seta rested on the laurels of the quirky Bio Sensor to do all the marketing heavy lifting, but how many people would have actually shelled out for four of them?</p>
	<p>There is some fun to be had, as the basic Tetris formula is present, but after a while the random architectural and scenic images get boring, and even the little selection of music becomes quite dreary on repeat.</p>
	<p>There are better outings for Tetris on the N64, which remix the formula and add more value to the package. This game, however, could easily pass for a Super Nintendo game in the audio and visual departments, and even with a gimmicky sensor to use, it's not super exciting to play.</p>
