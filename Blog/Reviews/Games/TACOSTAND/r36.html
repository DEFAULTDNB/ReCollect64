	<h4>Waaah-co Taco</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Waluigi has just lost all of his and Wario's money at the slot machines as his Koopa Troopa landlord tells him that his rent is due. Luckily he gets an offer he cannot refuse to work off his debt at a taco stand!</p>
	<p><i>Waluigi's Taco Stand</i> is a 2018 <i>Super Mario 64</i> ROM hack from Kaze Emanuar, based on a 2012 meme, where you have to work your way up the ranks as a food service operative. When a patron places their order, you have to go to exotic locations such as Taco Canyon, or Taco Volcano to harvest the ingredients. Mushrooms, spicy sauce, coconut, garlic, eyeballs, tomato, cactus, lettuce, fish, cheese, bully horns, and beef (which looks like bacon IMHO) all become staples of your shopping itinerary. Once you have the exact list your customer requested, you go back and serve it.</p>
	<p>The principle is fun, and though it feels like it should be fast-paced, the game gets monotonous extremely quickly. Thankfully, there are multiple locales to grab your ingredients from, though if you have an eight-strong queue, you'll be dipping back and forth into each mini-world that amount of times. Interestingly, Waluigi has infinite health to scrump those goodies (or nasties), so don't be afraid to take risks, especially when skimming across lava or hurling yourself off a tall cliff.</p>

	<h4>Waaaah-t a Meme</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Graphically, the game stands out as having a wonderfully articulate purple Waluigi model, with accompanying sound effects and voice clips that really set the tone of the game. Waluigi is a stone-cold taskmaster, and he doesn't care who knows it. Interestingly, some of the music used in the game is from <i>Ocarina of Time</i> like the shop theme, other environment-specific tracks comes from games like <i>Mario Kart 64</i>.</p>
	<p>Throughout the game, I noticed a few small glitches. Nothing game-breaking, but there were times that I couldn't see a wall or Waluigi's model didn't appear to be touching a surface he was hanging from. It's minor and doesn't affect gameplay much, but it sometimes stopped me in my tracks for a few seconds. Usually adjusting the camera angle sorts them out.</p>

	<p>All told, the game feels very well put together, and I love the fact that it in itself is a mockery of a supposed lost Nintendo game. So much so that Kaze produced a variety of lost/found adverts and promotional material, one of which can be seen here:</p>

	<h4>RENT PAID!</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>In a similar vein as games like <i>Order Up</i> and <i>Overcooked 1&2</i>, this game feels like it's aiming to get your heart pumping and your brain remembering. The problem I found, is that there is no time pressure, no crunch, and very little excitement in getting the order out as fast as possible. The game also doesn't allow you to consult a list, so if you forget the order or grab too many different things, you'll have to make it again.</p>
	<p><i>Waluigi's Taco Stand</i> needed a mechanic at the end of the collecting portion, something that watches Waluigi put it together, or better, allowed you to build your meals in another mini-game. Perhaps my expectations are too high nowadays. Kaze really set the bar high with his most recent <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b69" target="_blank">Return to Yoshi's Island demo</a>.</p>
	<p>Overall, this ROM hack is simply too short and too repetitive to recommend from the rooftops. You should definitely check it out if you like Waluigi, but keep your expectations low for any real "core" gameplay.</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Nice Waluigi model.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Four worlds and 14 tacos (stars).<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Works on real hardware<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Fun idea.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Just 20 minutes of gameplay.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Worlds are tiny.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>No list to consult.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p><i>Waluigi's Taco Stand</i> is certainly a fun concept, only let down by repetitive gameplay and lack of true variety across its 20-25 minute length. If the game had slightly more about it, I think it could have been labelled essential to play.</p>
