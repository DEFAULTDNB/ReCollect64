	<h4>The Leader of the Bunch</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><a href="https://x.com/DefaultDNB/status/1938274509456621594">I asked, and you answered</a>! With <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i> coming out on Nintendo Switch 2 exclusively on the 17th of June 2025, now is the perfect time to get reacquainted with the last truly 3D monkey-based title to grace our home consoles.</p>
	<p><i>Donkey Kong 64</i> was the first 3D ape adventure by the team at Rare in 1999. Prior to this, the <i>Donkey Kong Country</i> Trilogy was barreling across the Super Nintendo Entertainment System with Donkey Kong Country (1994), Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest (1995), and Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble! (1996).</p>
	<p>With an unconvoluted story that has you tracking down your imprisoned friends and reclaiming your golden banana stash before King K. Rool manages to obliterate the DK Isles, the game starts off with lengthy cutscenes and then drops you in at a rather leisurely pace. You learn some skills, go hunting for coins and bananas, and then play some mini-games, rather than running headlong into King K. Rool from the get-go.</p>
	<p>It's not mind-blowing, but it's typical Rare storytelling with a basic underlying flow and action-packed explorative gameplay as well as plenty of character progression and dialogue at the fore.</p>

	<h4>You Know Him Well</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>You start out by doing four tutorial levels: barrel throwing, orange grenade chucking, vine swinging and monkey swimming. Cranky (DK's dad) gifts you the simian slam, aka the ground pound, which gets you out of the training area and into the main meat of the game, DK Isles.</p>
	<p>Throughout your expedition, Squawks is your mouthy guide, pointing you in the right direction and giving you story beats in between the cutscenes of K. Rool absolutely hating on DK's progression. Notably, only King K. Rool has proper voice lines, or rather, sentences, in this game. The rest have noises and the occasional word here or there.</p>
	<p>There are a total of 8 levels to discover: Jungle Japes, Angry Aztec, Frantic Factory, Gloomy Galleon, Fungi Forest, Crystal Caves, Creepy Castle and Hideout Helm, each with a boss fight to complete. Beating the bosses gives you keys, which go towards unlocking K. Lumsy. You'll need all eight to rescue him, which might well be super-duper handy later on, hint-hint.</p>
	<p>Each level requires you to find five golden bananas, at least 75 regular bananas (for a banana medal), and rescue a character or NPC in need. The level bosses include Army Dillo, Dogadon, Mad Jack, Toy Monster, Puftoss, King Kut Out and the pugilist, King Krusha K. Rool himself.</p>
	<p>The boss fights are quite basic and very similar in nature, but they're full of edge-of-the-seat action. Working out how to beat each one is engaging, but ultimately it's just how quick or how overpowered they are that determines how difficult they actually are to beat.</p>

	<h4>He's Finally Back</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Unlockable characters Diddy, Tiny, Lanky and Chunky each need to be utilised in the right areas by entering the tag barrel. Essentially, each character is required for a specific section and specific collectibles, and you have to chop and change between all five of them (once they're unlocked) in order to gather everything there is to find. Each one's weapons and instruments unlock different switches and vanquish different foes that allow you to progress where others simply cannot.</p>
	<p>Every Kong has the butt slam move (upgradable twice), as well as a basic jump, long jump, backflip, an attack, and each has their own traits that are individual. These movesets can be gradually upgraded and expanded upon by purchasing Cranky's potions with coins:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><span style="background-color:yellow">DK is the main man and collects the standard yellow items. His instrument is the bongos; obviously, his weapon is the coconut gun, and his special moves include "Baboon Blast" to use barrels to travel, "Strong Kong" for temporary invincibility, and "Gorilla Grab" to grab and pull switches.</span>
	</ul>
	<ul>
	<li><span style="background-color:red; color: white;">Diddy Kong collects red items, plays the guitar and packs twin peanut pop-guns. His personal moves include the "Simian Spring" jump, "Chimpy Charge" to headbutt stuff, and "Rocketbarrel Boost" to fly around with a jetpack!</span>
	</ul>
	<ul>
	<li><span style="background-color:purple; color: white;">Tiny Kong collects purple collectibles, plays the saxophone, has the feather crossbow weapon, and has gymnastic agility and a higher jump than the others. She has the "Ponytail Whirl" to whip bad guys, "Monkey-port" to teleport to her pads, and "Mini Monkey" moves to shrink down to tiny proportions, getting access to places the others cannot.</span>
	</ul>
	<ul>
	<li><span style="background-color:lightblue">Lanky Kong collects blue collectibles, plays the trombone, has the grape blowpipe (grape shooter) weapon, and has flexible, stretchy, limbs. His unique moves include the "Orange Stand" to climb slopes and "Orange Stand Sprint" to run, much like Kazooie's moves. He also has the "Baboon Balloon" move, which inflates him, allowing Lanky to float up to new heights.</span>
	</ul>
	<ul>
	<li><span style="background-color:green; color: white;">Chunky Kong collects green items, plays the triangle instrument, and has the pineapple launcher weapon, and while he has powerful moves, he's slow. His special moves include the  "Hunky Chunky" to make him gigantic, "Primate Punch" to smash through doors and barriers, and "Gorilla Gone", which makes him temporarily invisible.</span>
	</ul>

	<p>Together the core five form a ragtag band of powered-up and heavily armed heroes whose powers combine to access all areas and overthrow the Kremling King and his ambitions of destruction. Each character plays differently to the last, so there is quite a nice variety and balance to swapping through the Kong crew.</p>
	<p>There are a couple more notable Kongs in the game too. Wrinkly Kong is now a ghost who provides hints if you get stuck; she appears to have died at some point in the DK timeline. Cranky, as mentioned before, dishes out potions to unlock character special powers. Funky Kong is in charge of the weapons. He's an arms dealer who doles out guns and ammo like no one's business. He makes money while the island suffers; thankfully, he will come into his own later on in the game!</p>
	<p>Candy Kong upgrades instruments and weapons as well as health, ironically giving you additional big juicy melons, ohh-errr. There's Scoff and Troff, the hippo and pig duo who are the gatekeepers of the boss fights; feed them your collected bananas to unlock the battles, and last but not least, there is Snide the weasel and the Banana Fairy, who count up your collected blueprints and photos taken by Tiny's camera, respectively, unlocking minigames to replay at any time and allowing you to rewatch cutscenes and even the game's final ending.</p>

	<h4>To Kick Some Tail</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>After you have Kong-quered the eight main levels of the game, you hit the boss, King K. Rool, in the King Kruiser II airship. All your simian efforts combine in a Power Rangers-esque display of teamwork and friendship, but I won't post any spoilers for those who still haven't finished it after 26 years.</p>
	<p>In summary, I found the game to be brilliantly captivating; there is a constant flow of interesting things to find and do, and NPCs to interact with. Throughout my time replaying it, I found the camera and its various angles to be the thing that hampered my progress the most, not the scale nor the difficulty. I would jump for a coin while swinging off of a vine and miss by miles. Swimming under water, I would have constant depth perception bafflement. Where you usually have a shadow to guide you as to where you might land or what you're above, it wasn't so apparent here because you're high up in a tree canopy or in a super deep barrel of water, and it repeatedly tripped me up, which became frustrating.</p>
	<p>This, plus the constant switching of monkeys and the filler-feeling mini-games, put a slight dampener on an otherwise excellent experience. I cannot help but feel that DK64 tries to do everything all at once by cramming in too much. Too many collectibles, too many mini-games too frequently, and too many long cut scenes. It's a little overwhelming, but with around 15-20 hours of gameplay and 30-40+ hours for completion, it's entirely optional to collect absolutely everything.</p>	
	<p>The multiplayer "Kong Battle" mode is insane. With Monkey Smash (death match) and Battle Arena (king of the hill), two to four players can brawl around three levels in a frantic chimped-out war. This mode is often overlooked, as the game rarely gets a mention as a multiplayer game because the single-player adventure is always the main event.</p>
	<p>Don't sleep on the multiplayer; it's utterly fantastic. There are no CPU/bot modes to hone your skills, so it relies on you organising three friends to come round for a few hours of trash-talk-fuelled couch conflict!</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>8 huge, explorable levels.<br>

	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Camera angle woes.<br>

	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p><i>Donkey Kong 64</i> is certainly a strange animal, mainly because I find it so complex compared to its 2D counterparts. It's not quite my favourite platformer from Rare, but it's certainly up there as one of the best games on the system thanks to sprawling levels, multiple playable characters, an often-overlooked multiplayer mode, and a Guinness World Record-holding 3800+ collectibles (that's over 10x the number required to beat the game!).</p>
