	<h4>Roster Rumpus</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> came out in 1999, it made waves as the first fighting game to feature multiple recognisable franchises within a single title that could finally put to rest whether Link could beat Mario in a bout of fisticuffs.</p>
	<p><i>Smash Remix</i> is the unofficial evolution of the series, taking its core DNA, expanding it, and reconfiguring it in a far more balanced and appealing way. The first mod appeared publicly in 2018, and since then there have been 29 released (major and minor) to soup up the action.</p>
	<p>As of version 1.5.2, there are the 12 strategically unaltered original characters, along with 18 fresh new faces to brawl with. There are also over 150 stages to duke it out on, and everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, is unlocked from the very beginning!</p>

	<h4>Combat Contest</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I have never been a huge advocate for <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> on the N64. Since 1992, I have rather strictly been a <i>Street Fighter 2</i> fan for 2D fighting games and <i>Tekken 3</i> for 3D fighting come 1997. Nothing else could compete in my eyes, so I remained extremely blinkered to those two for the longest time.</p>
	<p><i>Smash Remix</i> is something I have secretly been wanting to try out for years. Watching the release trailers, getting hyped over the new playable characters, and looking forward to the next announcements has become a staple when frequenting the internet. So playing the game would be a challenge for me, something I had never really put any time into prior to this last two weeks!</p>
	<p>I was immediately wowed by the quality of this mod. Every element is polished and congruent with the original, untouched version of the game. It's so well done, I had to take a moment to double-check exactly what the original featured. The fact that lead developer, Smasher: The Smashfather, has kept in the original modes, the original characters (untouched), and additional modes, options, characters, and more within the exact framework of the original so well is a testament to their commitment.</p>

	<h4>Fighting Frenzy</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>	
	<p>I launched into several games, choosing my favourite-looking characters, facing off against Team Sonic, Wolf/Falco/Slippy/Peppy, polygon characters, Goemon, Master Hand, Dragon King, and stages that blew my mind, like DataDyne, Spiral Mountain, Mute City, Rainbow Road, Melrode (Quest 64), and Casino Night Zone. Even the sound effects are bespoke per level, and the announcer sounds spot on for every character. Colour me massively impressed.</p>
	<p>The learning curve for this game is quite slippery, in my opinion. I found it to be an interesting control scheme, not super intuitive to be honest, and quite strenuous to remove my muscle memory from other games to adapt to this game. I particularly found it odd that so many buttons control jumping and so few attacking. Every C-button and up on the stick launches you into the air, juxtaposed with just two buttons to attack with.</p>
	<p>Once I had a vague understanding of the mechanics, I got myself familiar with special moves and dodging. It might seem obvious, but from a Street Fighter standpoint, blocking, parrying, and crossing up is the norm. I wouldn't usually roll through an opponent to dodge them or purposefully drop through the floor. It was an adventure, but I managed to eke my way through the levels until I hit the bonus stages. That's when I had PTSD-style flashbacks. I really hate the target smash one; I swear it's impossible!</p>

	<p>Mashing buttons will not get you anywhere; you need to master a variety of moves, namely well-timed air jumps, to save your skin if you get blasted off the edge. Battering your enemy's energy towards the 100% mark means you will have a much easier time smashing your character into oblivion and winning a match. I was amazed at the number of character-specific moves, like Conker's chainsaw and Banjo using Kazooie as a gun or a battering ram.</p> 
	<p>The sheer variety within this mod gives you so much to learn that it can feel a little overwhelming if you never get much time to sit and focus in on a game. My best advice is to pick one character and go to town learning everything, trying every tactic, and attempting to beat the game each sitting. This way you can experience every character over a series of 30 sessions, and get to grips with the ones you love or hate.</p>
	<p><i>Smash Remix</i> is a triumph in its construction, and so finely balanced I can see why it's used competitively. The game exhibits incredible playability, even for newcomers, and the variety of content within means that it takes a very long time to see the same levels, characters, or moves. Overall, it's fresh and inviting, and as long as you can rationalise with yourself that it is nothing like any other (more realistic) fighting game, I highly recommend giving it a go!</p>
