	<h4>Ruff & Tumble</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>It's my 40th review for ReCollect64, so it could only be <i>40 Winks</i>!</p>
	<p><i>40 Winks</i> is an enigmatic game. On one hand, it was cancelled by GT Interactive following the lacklustre sales of the PlayStation version in 1999, and on the other, it was completely finished for N64 but it didn't see the light of day until 2018, when Piko Interactive bought the license and put it out via <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/retrogames/40-winks-a-new-nintendo-64-game">Kickstarter</a>.</p>
	<p>I recently picked up the game and controller bundle for £50 on eBay, which I think is a decent price, considering that it is still available to buy online for £61.38 without the controller on the <a href="https://www.pikointeractive.com/home/40-Winks-N64-BACKORDER-p132666160">official Piko site</a>. My official controller review will be coming soon, but today, this is all about the game itself!</p>
	<p>Beginning the game, you would be forgiven for thinking it feels a little bit like a Rare title. There are spangly motion graphics, comically goggly-eyed characters, and a nice palette of colours used throughout. It looked great, I was looking forward to sinking my teeth into something I had never played before. Unfortunately, once you dip beneath the surface, it quickly loses its lustre and feels like a basic collect-a-thon with very little wow factor.</p>
	<p>The first thing I noticed was the neat little candle Ruff was holding. The second thing I noticed was how it didn't affect its surroundings at all. I guess it was a bit much to assume the light might emit a source and illuminate areas, but given the looming darkness of the game, I thought it might at least do something!</p>
	<p>The story goes that Nitekap has stolen the winks (peaceful sleep) to force the world to endure constant nightmares. His minions, Threadbear and the hoodwinks (terrible names), are complicit in his plan. Spoiler alert: a clock triggered Nitekaps villain arc. Honestly, that's the crux of the plot.</p>

	<p>Let's not beat around the bush; this is a simple 3D action platformer, so most of your time is spent exploring the house and the six realms by navigating tricky jumps, avoiding hazards, etc. I found the game to be very short in places. Where games like <i>Super Mario 64, Conker's Bad Fur Day</i>, or the <i>Banjo</i> games open up to sprawling maps, this wasn't the case here. Each section of the house has a door to unlock, a warp point to find, and dream keys to gather. Beyond that, it's very restricted in its scope.</p>
	<p>I enjoyed the platforming and collecting to a point, but it was far too simplistic. For advanced gamers and people who enjoyed the other N64 platformers that helped to cement the system's legendary status in the annals of time, this title is going to become very underwhelming extremely quickly.</p>
	<p>Each world is composed of three levels, a boss fight, and a race. They contain different children's party-esque themes, such as pirates, ninjas, medieval, robots, dinosaurs, jester/fairy, etc. You must defeat the themed enemies, find four dream keys per level, a handful of winks, utilise disguises and jack-in-the-box power-ups (only four of each per character), and beat the boss to consider the area done. The race is purely optional if you want to pick up some bonus goodies.</p>

	<h4>Not Like a Boss</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The boss fights in this game are egregious at best. Tiny arenas, horribly repetitive enemies, and the difficulty spike make it all the worse.</p>
	<p>I was not a fan of the constant deaths it took to figure out and then take down the bosses. Their battle mechanics were neither inventive nor fun. These half assed bosses were purely used as excessively draining barriers to the next level.</p>
	<p>The majority of my deaths in levels came from falling off things or falling down pits that looked like ascending/descending platforms. At points, it felt unfair to have so many traps waiting to mess up your flow.</p>

	<h4>Sleep Inducing</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>If you have difficulty trudging through the levels and getting dominated by boring bosses, feel free to look at these cheats to further your cause. I have to admit, I used the life cheats a couple of times because I was getting beaten to death by gangs of tiny enemies and hordes of larger enemies. They repetedly zapped my health and lives.</p>

	<p><i>40 Winks</i> is not exactly an easy game. It's all about the grind. The collect-a-thon mentality only carries the game so far, but it feels like a horrible chore of having too many plates to spin. As I understand it, Zs are needed for health, moons power up your special attack (Z), dream keys unlock bosses (12 required per boss), cogs are for opening locked doors in each dream/nightmare, winks open doors in your home hub level, and lastly, RT coins are for gaining additional lives.</p>
	<p>GT Interactive and Eurocom could have simplified this by using the three life system, three hits, Z's to replenish hits, and collecting 100 of them give you an extra life. Ditch off RT coins altogether. Equally, the cogs and winks system is confusing. Both unlock doors, but you need to keep tabs on each to know where you are for both. Just use one or the other and keep it simple!!</p>
	<p><i>40 Winks</i> isn't a terrible game, but it also cannot compete with the likes of <i>Super Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie/Tooie, Conker's Bad Fur Day, Donkey Kong 64</i>, or <i>Rocket Robot on Wheels</i>. It's a shame, but I can see why the game got pulled at the last minute. It would not have sold well in comparison to its peers.</p>
	<p>As a niche piece, it's cool to have in my collection, but I don't think I will ever actively wish to replay <i>40 Winks</i>. Once was more than enough for me. Time to put it back to sleep.</p>
