	<h4>What Goes Up..</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>Bust-A-Move 2: Arcade Edition</i> is known under many guises across many platforms, but essentially the twin bubble dragons Bubb and Bobb (<i>Puzzle Bobble</i>) are back with the home rendition of the arcade edition of their second outing.</p>
	<p>Prepare, aim, and launch your bubbles using the most straightforward controls available, then match the colours to clear the screen. It's like the inverse of Tetris, whereby the screen shuffles downwards whilst you fire your salvo upwards. Connect three or more, and they pop, dropping anything attached to them.</p>
	<p>I remember playing this game in late 1998, having played the Japanese import of <i>Bust a Groove</i> on PSX some time earlier. I was so confused as to why this game was not a dance battle simulator, but I quickly got past that and got hooked on the puzzly goodness!</p>

	<h4>Poppin Off</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>This game contains an arcade mode as well as a two-player versus mode that allows you to compete against a "friend" or, failing that, a CPU opponent. Oddly, no four-player mode is present in the N64 incarnation.</p>
	<p>The single-player game pits you against an alphabet of stages with a total of 30 levels of increasingly time-crunching bubble-popping difficulty. The basic rule is to not let the bubbles amass to a point that they dangle past the line from which you're firing the bubbles from. If that happens, it's game over. All you need to do is maintain control and keep a steady aim to pop bubbles as high up as you can to clear the screen quickly.</p>
	<p>The controls lend themselves perfectly for this type of game, with the L and R shoulder buttons acting as fine-tuning, and the analogue stick allowing you to swing around more wildly. Levels begin with an aiming marker that shows the bubble's trajectory and reflective aiming assistance, and you hit A to fire. Later on this snooker-like guideline vanishes, and it's up to you to judge the angles correctly before you fire.</p>

	<h4>Busting Moves</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Levels have a distinct pattern to them, they're not random; they all play out the same no matter how many times you play them. The mechanical crushing machine periodically pushes the entire play space down towards you at increasingly speedy rates, and the number of useful bubbles you get decreases meaning you have to manage the screen's contents until you get something handy to clear them before they hit the "deadline".</p>
	<p>There is a clear strategy to each level, and special bubbles appear to help or hinder your progress. Star bubbles pop all bubbles of the colour you fire at it, so hammering it with a red one when everything is hanging on a bunch of reds will drop the lot. Metal bubbles plough through everything they touch until they reach the top. Jama bubbles cannot be popped and must be dropped by destroying the bubbles they hang from. Lastly, Jama blocks are immovable objects that cannot be popped or dropped. You must work around these in order to succeed.</p>
	<p>The practice and time attack modes are perfect for honing your bustable moves. The faster you work, the more time bonuses you gain in all modes. The more points you earn, the higher your name will appear on the high score table!</p>

	<h4>Dubble Trouble</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With the 64-bit quadruple-player-capable console in the hands of Taito, why didn't they attempt to make this title a console-exclusive 4-player puzzle-a-thon? Perhaps the 64-bit console couldn't handle that number of bubbles on screen at any one time, but nowadays games like <i>Puzzle Bobble Everybubble!</i> feature 4-player modes for sofa play on Nintendo Switch.</p>
	<p>The two-player mode is superb and definitely add masses of replayability by introducing a random human factor to the fold. The CPU is also decent throughout, challenging when it needs to be and forgiving when you start out, so that you can ease into learning the game's moves and mechanics. Nothing beats facing off against a real player, though.</p>
	<p>I have to admit that <i>Bust-A-Move 2: AE</i> is one of my go-to games when it comes to letting off steam. It's casual yet taxing and quick yet engaging. Definitely worth a play, with or without organic human friends!</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>30 varied levels.<br>

	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Two-player mayhem.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Infinite replayability.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>

	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>No 4-player mode.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>Such a simple game, and yet so fun. The only way it could be made better would be to have it be a frantically-joyous four-way experience. Later versions of the game had a level editor too, which sadly never made it into the N64 release. It missed out adding in a creative element, and I feel that something like that would have definitely extended the replayability of this to near infinite proportions.</p>
