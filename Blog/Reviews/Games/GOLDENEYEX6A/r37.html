	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When GoldenEye X first burst onto the scene in 2010 it was a revolution. The possibility of upgrading one of the greatest games ever made to the enhanced engine of its spiritual successor was an incredible notion. Rare themselves said that <i>Perfect Dark</i>'s engine could run 007 at "better than 30 FPS"; a 50% increase over <i>GoldenEye</i>'s 20 FPS average pacing. Now that it's a partial reality, how does it play?</p>

	<p><a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b74" target="_blank">GoldenEye X 6A</a> has gone from strength to strength over the past 11 releases, now spanning 15 years. Playing this version feels like things have progresse so much so that you can almost feel an end product in sight.</p>
	<p>This transition does not come without its caveats. Though it is undoubtedly a marvellous feat of fan service for the 28-year-old game, certain aspects have effortlessly flourished while others have been dragged, kicking and screaming, into the revised engine.</p>
	<p>The gun barrel animation is gone, interlude animations have been skipped (for now), the immensely iconic health bar is entirely gone in favour of Joanna's revamped one, and the swap to <i>Perfect Dark</i>'s updated AI means that the difficulty feels slightly increased, even on Agent difficulty.</p>

	<h4>From Modders With Love</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>It's no mean feat to have ported all 20 single-player levels (nine fully working), nor 11 original multiplayer levels plus 11 bonus levels, adding an extra mode called "The Duel" and retaining 30 VR missions for good measure. Wreck and his team have certainly pulled out all the stops to give us plenty of content packed into this version.</p>
	<p>As you can tell, the additions far outweigh the omissions. We now also have two levels of crouching, bonus dialogue, extended back rooms, enhanced lighting, layers of rain, ricochet sparks, more enemy animations, blood spatter, better enemy AI, and simulants in multiplayer.</p>
	<p>The extended-level backrooms are additions that pay respectful homage to the levels. For example, in Silo, you now start at the vents at the bottom, as the original developers intended, taking a ladder to get to the recognisable start of the level from the retail version of <i>GoldenEye</i>. On Runway, you now have a door that leads behind the chainlink fences by the first building to your left as you emerge from Facility. There is also one on the runway itself where the sentry guns fortify the area. These additions don't detract anything from the levels; they serve to add more intrigue and areas to explore.</p>
	<p>I would love to see an option to play the Dam level with the island restored. Grabbing a key, taking a boat from the dock, and grabbing whatever item is needed from the mini-fortress would be fantastic, though this would alter the flow of the level as we know it; it would satiate the minds of those who lived through the years of rumours and speculation.</p>

	<h4>Bonded Together</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The combination of the classic Bond levels within the enhanced engine is a glimpse of what is possible, making it an exciting time to get into ROM hacks, level replacements, and modifications. This is the best way you can experience individual solo levels at the moment, but until the modification is completed, the most seamless way to experience 007 is to stick to the OG game with all of the levels and all of the cut scenes intact.</p>
	<p>We have to remember that the main crux of <i>GoldenEye X</i> is the multiplayer aspect. Single-player levels come secondary to the competitive arena of its strongest modes. Having said that, cooperative modes added to the levels that are set up and completed are exciting to play, and another benefit of using this feature-rich engine over the previous.</p>
	<p>As a multiplayer experience, this is excellence incarnate. As a single-player jaunt, it is far from complete (the glitched texture state of the MI6 Headquarters, aka Carrington Institute, freaks me out every time, plus James still has Joanna's voice!). The multiplayer modes and levels are second to none and reinvigorate the already stellar multiplayer of <i>GoldenEye 007</i> by adding more modes, more levels, modernising mechanics, and allowing for far more character combinations. The multiplayer modes are so smooth and so refined to play; it is a triumph and highly recommended to play with mates or AI simulants.</p>
	<p>I can't wait to see what gets added to the next update, because Wreck and his team are now on somewhat of a roll and actively fixing, tweaking, and adding new features in private, ready for the next version. You never know; they may even bring back "Perfect Head" mode, where you could connect a Game Boy camera to a Transfer Pak accessory to scan in your face.</p>
