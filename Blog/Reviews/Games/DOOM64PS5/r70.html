	<h4>Reigning Blood</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Nightdive Studio's 2019 remaster of the single-player 1997 classic is a collaboration between Bethesda Softworks and the KEX engine that elevates the Nintendo 64's efforts into the realm of 4K visuals and super slick frame rates.</p>
	<p>With 32 levels exclusively built for <i>Doom 64</i> (28 story levels and 4 secret levels), the version I'm diving into on the PS5 is technically the PS4 version running in compatibility mode on the PlayStation 5 Pro, and wow, does it fly!</p>

	<h4>Doom and Bloom</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>Doom 64</i> began life in late 1994 at Midway Games San Diego Studio, with the working title "Doom: The Absolution". The game's title was later changed to reinforce the Nintendo 64's brand image, and the name "Absolution" was given to the final level as a nod to the developers.</p>
	<p>At release in 1997, I remember the game being a phenomenal iteration of the title I had grown up playing on the SNES and PC, but with far more impressive visuals, featuring unique enemy and weapon sprites, as well as plenty more levels to explore. This version would go on to become the most popular by far, with average scores of 7/10 and ports for every platform going forward.</p>
	<p>The only thing I remember missing was multiplayer. For a console that sported 4 controller sockets, it felt like a very strange choice not to have at least some multiplayer aspect, but due to time and cartridge constraints, multiplayer in 1997 was not to be. Alas, in the year of our lord 2025, <i>Doom 64</i>, in its current standing, still does not feature multiplayer, and it's a crying shame.</p>
	<p>There are four difficulty settings as per the N64 version, which essentially alters enemies abilities to soak up bullets and their overall aggression and movement speed when it comes to defending their turf.</p>
	<p>The PS4/PS5 version features 60 FPS compared to the consoles targeted 30 FPS, and the KEX engine allows for smoother rendering, fixed lighting and glow effects, improved cycle accuracy with corrected timings, and even updated and restored collision detection. It goes without saying that this game is retro-gorgeous.</p>

	<h4>Frag, Gib & Slay</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Featuring 10 weapons, including the Pistol, BFG, Chain Gun, Rocket Launcher, Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Plasma Gun, and the upgradable Unmaker, which is a laser-shooting carcus rifle that can be enhanced by finding demon keys, <i>Doom 64</i> covers the bases of close-quarter combat as well as devastatingly powerful projectiles, though it never leans into precision aiming or sniping. I did wonder going into this if the controls would include the ability to look up and down or use gyro, but they don't and that's actually a good thing. The game feels more authentic, more true to its pseudo-2D roots and early-days-of-PC-gaming control scheme. It's simple to grasp, and doen't over-face the player.</p>
	<p>Everything has been given a fresh lick of HD polish. From the weapons to the enemies and their obliterated, chewed-up cadavers; this version looks incredible. The blend of 2D sprites against 3D visuals is still a classic and striking combination. I love it.</p>
	<p>The 3D geometry flows around like butter, with every edge and vertex hammering in the precision of the engine; every wall, ceiling, and pit is stunningly sharp and features textures that look great from afar, but have that quintessential gritty, grainy 90's dithering up close. The 2D elements are beautifully crisp and yet retain a jagged quality to their edges, thankfully with no attempt made to soften them using daft modern techniques or AI enhancements. It's rough, rugged, and raw.</p>

	<h4>Refurbished Running</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>My one issue with this version is run/autorun. I kept forgetting to turn it on and so kept getting stuck in areas that required it. The best example I can give is that of level 6, where after obtaining the yellow key, you get into a room with an elevating platform and three areas ever-so-slightly out of reach. It took me AGES to figure this bit out, because I thought autorun was on, and it wasn't; I kept attempting the jumps only to fail. Eventually I figured out that I had accidentally toggled it off at some point, and with no modern gameplay hints/tips system in the game, I was frustratingly stuck for a while.</p>
	<p>Silly quirks aside, this game rocks. The bosses and baddies require a pummeling, even on more lenient difficulties, and the feeling of progression nicely ramps up once you find the keycard you're looking for or thwart the Mother Demon.</p>
	<p>Unlocking the seven additional lost levels is interesting because there are two ways to do it. Firstly, beat all levels and you'll have access to the second campaign, or alternatively, shoot the 10 barrels scattered around level 1 in a specific order, and you'll unlock the "Hectic" level, which you must beat to unlock the second story mode. Hectic itself is tricky AF, with traps set to lure you to your death; however, the additional levels you'll gain access to do also act as an interesting story bridge, connecting <i>Doom 64</i> to other games in the franchise.</p>
	<p>Overall, I'm still a huge fan of this game, and I'm still happy to rampage through it at any time. I just wish that there were more options for restored multiplayer or cooperative (from the cancelled multiplayer-focussed sequel <i>Doom 64 2</i> which, oddly, was also referenced as "Doom: The Absolution"). <i>Doom 64</i> is begging to be played with friends, and though this port strives for authenticity, I think it could have been better exapanded to indulge players with a few more 90s-era features that would get your friends crowding around your sofa again.</p>
