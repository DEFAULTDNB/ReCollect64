	<h4>Culture Clash Clarity</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>What if <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> got a spin-off series of games that combined the cast of characters we all know and love and set it in a gritty court of law, with Link as the main attorney, giving film-noir style inner monologues?</p>
	<p><a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b163">Team Newer recently put together such a blend of games</a> and given it all the polish and style of a professional-grade ROM hack, but one question remains: is it any fun to play?</p>
	<p>This review might contain spoilers below, so please play the game before reading. Spoiler alert for the spoiler alert: this ROM hack is great, so you won't be disappointed.</p>

	<h4>**SPOILERS AHEAD**</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The story begins with Princess Zelda walking into the crime scene, with Talon apparently having been killed by Malon, his own daughter. Link, who's been operating professionally now for seven years, takes the case, and without being given any background as to what the defendant says happened, you're dropped into the thick of it and it's up to you to unravel the story and present the evidence to strengthen your defense against Mr Dragmire.</p>
	<p>Ganondorf's case is that Malon killed Talon to inherit Lon Lon Ranch. Malon was found unresponsive at the scene, and since no one else was there, she must be guilty. Impa, the chief Shieka Force homicide detective, presents the autopsy report, the murder weapon, and the ranch inventory confirming that nothing was stolen, so it wasn't a botched robbery.</p>
	<p>Using the record of evidence, Link gets to cross-examine Malon and Zelda, as well as Impa and others. By presenting evidence on statements that contradict something that has been presented, you can make a case against the prosecution or call out something that doesn't quite line up or something you think is entirely false. In this case Princess Zelda, of all people, embellishes a lot of details, so calling her out on these is crucial to confirm the facts. Getting these things entered or struck from the record during the proceedings also helps your seemingly impossible defence.</p>
	<p>I really enjoyed working my way through the case, but from the beginning, I realised where this was going. Part of me felt elated to have had a correct hunch so early on, but another part of me thought it was indicated too early in the game, and so I knew what the outcome would be from the beginning. It's tough for the creators to make a game that purposefully drops hints without giving it away. If you're not paying attention, you might miss fine details and things you would otherwise consider insignificant.</p>

	<h4>ROM Related Rebuttal</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With a complete genre swap from adventure game to courtroom drama, I really appreciate the effort that has gone into this hack to get the feeling of a tense period in court over to the player. The constant sniping back and forth with Link and Ganondorf is brilliant, and the Judge and supporting characters lean into their roles and give this fictitious tale a fantastic grounding in the world of Ocarina of Time.</p>
	<p>From the testimonies to the mounting evidence, the story is enticingly well written and lavished with all manner of quips and jokes relating to the lore of Hyrule and the characters within it. There is so much dialogue and so many pieces of evidence presented that you really do need to be paying attention throughout, and this stream of interesting anecdotes and retconning of OOT is excellently captivating.</p>

	<h4>A Short Submission</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>This ROM hack is short but incredibly sweet with just eight points of cross-examination and one outcome. It would be excellent if they expanded on this further, giving more cases and more characters time to shine in these settings.</p>
	<p>I loved the use of the heart meter to demonstrate Link grasping for a break throughout the interrogations, characters reminiscing about OOT game elements and developing intricate backstories, and the side story that unfurls throughout the proceedings is incredibly well portrayed and succinctly delivered.</p>
	<p>For fans of the <i>Ace Attorney</i> (AA) series of games, they're in for a treat, but the average casual OOT enjoyer might not find so much fun in this spin-off, what with the extensive reading, the requirement of attention to detail, and a distinct lack of swordplay or explorative adventuring.</p>
	<p>Personally, I found it very engaging and extremely well put together, and as a person who never got into the AA games, I think the crossover with Zelda definitely draws me into wanting to play this more than any vanilla AA title ever will. I highly recommend everyone to check this ROM hack out, because it is AAA quality and absolutley class!</p>

	<p>While this ROM hack is great and polished to a professional standard, it's quite short. I could definitely envision a "Case 2" or more sequential volumes of this ROM hack being made, I really hope so, because the style and scope of this game is just too good!</p>
