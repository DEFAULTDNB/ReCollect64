	<h4>Calluses and Cramps</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>International Track & Field</i> is one of my enduring guilty pleasures. Ever since I first laid eyes on it, I haven't been able to stop playing. The raw competitive spirit of the game and the simple controls compulsively pull at you to have one more go.</p>
	<p>When I first played the game in 2000, I had a terrible technique. It was more a "slow and steady wins the race" kind of ethos, with creeping speed that barely increased each time. Eventually, I hit a wall. I remember playing <i>Lylat Wars</i> and needing the medals on various levels to unlock "on-foot multiplayer". I developed a method of holding my thumbs over A and B, then rocking the pad with my right hand, bringing the buttons to my fingers while jabbing at them. I have never, and will never, use "the pen in a sock trick" to rub the living heck out of the buttons, nor will I ever use turbo buttons on a third-party controller.</p>
	<p>My technique has even got me into the top 3 on <a href="https://cyberscore.me.uk/charts/134772" target="_blank">Cyberscore.me. Back in 2015, I submitted a single record for the 100 m dash, which is still there today</a>. With the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#ITFSG" target="_blank">ongoing competition I launched recently on this site</a>, I'm hoping to beat it soon!</p>

	<p>To build up power, you must alternate your tapping between two buttons. You can alternate A & B, C-Left & C-Right, or C-Up & C-Down. The power comes from your rhythm combined with how fast you tap them, so if you don't alternate, you won't fill up that empty bar or turn it red to max it out.</p>
	<p>With 14 events to conquer, <i>International Track and Field Summer Games</i> has a nice variety of running, swimming, jumping, and throwing events to choose from. The big five are the 100-meter dash, javelin, pole vault, long jump, and triple jump. The hammer throw is a close contender for one of those spots, and hurdles or high jump straight after that.</p>

	<h4>Feel the Burn</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Konami built the game for all three regions and named them slightly differently for each. Japan got <i>Ganbare! Nippon! Olympic 2000</i>, USA had <i>International Track and Field 2000</i>, and in Europe, it was known as <i>International Track and Field Summer Games</i>. Each version has small differences with the start screens and loading screens, but by and large, the game's code is identical across all three, and they appear to run at consistent speeds for competing internationally.</p>
	<p>Graphically, the game takes the typical 90s Konami character look and applies it to either a beefy or athletic male or female frame. Each of the 12 countries represented has their patriotic colours on, and the introductory animations that explain each event are clear and precise. The high-resolution mode makes the game look sharper without impacting performance or becoming a slideshow like many "Expansion Pak Enhanced" N64 games did. The crowds and officials are roughly cut-out 2D cardboard images, which could have looked better but must have been culled down to not slow the frame rates with unnecessary details.</p>
	<p>The sound effects in this game are simple but effective. Footsteps land, swimmers splash, and power Olympians scream, primally, at the point of release. The crowd cheers, claps, and chants along with you, and the judge's announcements echo realistically across the stadium.</p>

	<h4>Hurdles and Barriers</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When it comes to playing this game, you have to be fierce. If you go into it half-assed, you'll finish last. You need to put in the hard yards to perfect your start, technique, and finish. To start a race, for example, you need to go at the gunshot. Going before that gives you a false start, and two of those lead to disqualification. Starting the race perfectly gives you a lurching start; you instantly pop up into first position and start building your power bar quicker. Hammering the buttons to get that bar into the red becomes your next priority. Carefully alternating buttons and pushing yourself to tap both quickly and steadily for a sustained period is tough. You'll feel the pump in your dominant bicep, that's for sure. Lastly, when finishing a race, you can tap L, Z, or R to dip your head forward and over the line and shave off a couple more hundredths of a second. It all adds up!</p>
	<p>Some events come pre-capped. Pole vault, high jump, long/triple jump, and horizontal bar all have upper limits, but they're tough to achieve. Weight lifting is a prime example where it's not a hard event, but it's very quickly capped. The maximum weight you can lift is 280 KG, so there is no scope to go bigger, and everyone who achieves that amount will sit on the same number forever.</p>
	<p>My favourite events are the ones where if you go faster or throw further, you reach the upper echelons. Interestingly, the PSX version had no hard limits on most events and very little difference in timing. So much so that you could be pole vaulting over a crossbar that's levitating away from the uprights because you set it THAT high. The N64 version reins that sort of fantasy in and places a tougher emphasis on timing to get the lift and recovery just right.</p>
	<p>Some events feel impossible at first. The margin for error is so slim that it's like a kick in the face every time you fail. Breaststroke has such a specific technique that I found really hard to get right, but like everything else, it comes down to practice. This game is rewarding if you have the patience.</p>
