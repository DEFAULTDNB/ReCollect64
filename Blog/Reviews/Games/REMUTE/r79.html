	<h4>Musical Magic</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The humble Nintendo 64 cartridge was never classed as or proposed to become a storage medium for movies or music, and yet in March 2022, Denis Karimani, aka Remute, squeezed an impressive 15-track LP into just an 8 MB game cartridge, in conjunction with some clever N64 programming wizardry from Rasky, in a way that generates the music in-engine!</p>
	<p>For some reason, this package puts me in mind of the cracktro intros you would find embedded in old PC games, with edgy synth-wave beats and a quirky visualiser to show off which group did it first. Let's find out whether Remute's "R64" is all for show, or if it has more substance.</p>

	<h4>Niche N64 Noises</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As bizarre as it seems, there seems to have been a mini-rush to be the first to release an album on an N64 cart. "R64" however, does this natively, without packaging an MP3-capable N64 app into ROM form, and simply auto-playing a playlist. Only two albums were ever released in N64 cart format, Remute's "R64" and Belushi Speedball's thrash hardcore "What, Us Worry", which was released just two months after, in May 2022.</p>
	<div class="container">
	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>No tricks - this is not an embedded MP3-player, terribly compressed WAV-files on a microSD-card or other cheating: as with all previous Remute cartridge albums the sound on this cartridge gets generated and played back in realtime and it's all happening within meager 8 Megabytes! With 'R64' the Nintendo 64 console is your very own synthesizer and happy to serve you every time you turn it on and press play! 93,75 MHz, baby!</p>
	<p>For this wizardry Remute cooperated with genius Nintendo 64 dev Rasky, who is not only responsible for the sound engine and player-GUI, but also managed to put together an amazingly trippy 3D-experience accompanying Remute's music - you will...uhmmm... fly.</p>
	<p>The cartridges are region-free and will fit and play flawlessly on all models of the Nintendo 64 console - no matter if NTSC-U, PAL or NTSC-J.</p>

	<h4>Rhythmical Revelations</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Of the 15 tracks available, there is a nice mixture which spans a variety of tempos, mainly with gritty electro-pop synths and thumping techno beats. The genre is extremely niche and reminds me a little of Aphex Twin, whose music, though strange, was also just as catchy and earworm-like.</p>
	<p>The full line-up includes "The Mirror Reflects", "Superposition", "When A Thought Becomes A Weapon", "I Want To Go With U", "Your Church", "Business Coaching", "Stupid Fun", "Tradition Und Moderne", "On The Rocks", "Out Of Time", "What's Your Quote?", "Remains Of A Cult", "Jimmy Boy (Far Out)", "They Are Dangerous", and lastly, "A Message From The Creator".</p>
	<p>Within those, I found that "Your Church" was a personal fave of mine, with a breakbeat sound and crisp drums, and I have to give a special mention to "Out of Time", which is another banger with punchy <i>WipeOut 64</i> vibes. Lots of people seem to big-up "Super Position", but I honestly much preferred those two above everything else on offer.</p>
	<p>The music is generated in-engine, which is extremely ingenious, and pressing Z brings up a QR code that can be scanned to listen to a bonus track on Remute.org.</p>
	<p>The visualiser displays a kind of graphical landscape of the audible soundscape, but there isn't a great deal of variation in what you see. The B button flashes a colour on the screen and the A button makes it shake for a couple of seconds, but that's it. It would have been cool to have trippy colour options or a bolder assortment of shapes jutting out and flying around you; instead, it's a bit underwhelming and gimmicky in this respect.</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Very clever use of N64 technology.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>15 varied tracks: there's something for everyone.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Visualiser and simple controls.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i> Underwhelming visualiser.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i> €39.99 is an extremely big ask IMHO.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>As clever as this is, it's so niche that I don't think it would be on many people's "want" list. The 15 tracks are nice and varied, and the sound quality is excellent, but for €39.99 it would have been nice to have something more to it than just a basic interface and a visualiser.</p>
