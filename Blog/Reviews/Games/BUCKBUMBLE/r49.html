	<h4>Right About Now..</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Set in the year 2010, Buck Bumble tells a tale of pollution, devastation and a top-secret military cybernetic enhancement project known as project BUCK. Fighting against the Herd, it's up to the BUCK unit to blast away the mutant insectoids and free the land from the engulfing toxic contamination.</p>
	<p>Having last played this game several years ago, I have been excited to give it a fresh look in 2025. I remember the buzz surrounding it at the time of release because it was produced by Argonaut, the same developers behind the incredible <i>Star Fox</i> on the SNES!</p>

	<h4>It's Time to Rock..</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Starting out, you have access to a handful of tiny weapons, but as you progress, you gradually unlock quicker-firing and more devastating projectiles. The first weapon you get is a basic blaster, and it has no autofire, so your trigger finger gets a good workout right out of the gate. Thankfully, you quite quickly find a plasma blaster, and the blast-a-thon can really begin!</p>
	<p>There are 15 weapons to find, and some of the latter weapons provide more explosive action, with heat-seskers and even a fly-by-wire rocket launcher, which can really turn the tables on your foes. Collecting pollen that dangles off flowers replenishes your health, and you'll need to remember where you saw the last few drops if you come unstuck and get surrounded. More often than not I found myself struggling for health, but that loop-de-loop button on C-Right was a lifesaver on several occasions, letting me quickly gain a better tactical position against the waves of sting-crazy wasps and baddies.</p>
	<p>Using a third-person perspective, the sense of scale conveyed in this game is palpable. Every environment gives you a bee's-eye-view of your rural English surroundings, and the various objects strewn around the scenery add to the "Honey, I Shrunk The Kids" vibe of being small in a giant insect-riddled world. There are spider webs, turrets, and reinforced beetles to overcome in the search for keys to progress. Most of your time is spent following the radar and enjoying the vibes to the top-notch UK garage beats.</p>

	<h4>BIGGIDY-BUCK BUMBLE!</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>	
	<p>The game is spread across 20 levels with a plethora of bosses to beat along the way, but each level starts out visually similarly. It's only really a handful of levels that start in places that aren't a garden. While you can feel the DNA of <i>Star Fox</i> running within this pollen-coated variant, it's not quite on par with the original furry flight sim, mainly because the story feels very superficial and there is no cast of antagonist enemies that you feel the urge to tackle and vanquish. The game is teeming with grunt and brute-level enemies, a handful of bosses and just a couple of queens to take down.</p>
	<p>The effects in-game are awesome. Explosions feel powerful, smoke trails and sparks flood the screen to intensify the action. The animations of the enemies dive-bombing and careening out of control once you have drilled them full of bullets are fantastically cartoony, as are the accompanying sound effects.</p>
	<p>I really enjoyed replaying Buck Bumble, but I have to say it hasn't aged as well as I had hoped. The game needed a little more depth, more visual variation in the levels and perhaps even a two-player cooperative mode to ease the difficulty of some of the later levels. Instead, the multiplayer option feels like a lazy, tacked on dogfight mode that isn't fun for more than a few minutes.</p>

	<div class="col-container">
	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Brilliant blasting action.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>20 levels to hammer through.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>15 increasingly baddass weapons.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>The music adds a fantastic vibe.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Lacking depth.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Two-player mode is disappointing.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Quite tough to navigate in places.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>Buck Bumble is a huge amount of fun to play, but it's extremely limited in its narrative and cast, and while the levels are decent to explore, they aren't quite varied enough, in my opinion.</p>
	<p>This game is worth the time to play, but it only takes a couple of hours to blast through in its entirety. The two-player dogfights don't add anywhere near as much value to the game as the multiplayer does in <i>Lylat Wars</i>, which is disappointing.</p>
