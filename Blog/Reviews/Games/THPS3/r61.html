	<h4>Tricked Out</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The Birdman, Anthony Frank Hawk, is a huge icon in the world of skating and gaming, even in 2025. Since 1999 his signature games have gripped gamers and fans of the sport because of the fluid gameplay, exciting combos and heaps of unlockable tricks, gaps, collectables and characters.</p>
	<p>The third outing was the very last game to be physically released on the N64, and as a result, it only saw a release in the United States in late 2001. A crying shame for us Europeans, we had to either import it or play it on an emulator. The first time I played the three-qual was at university on a Windows PC, I had a cracked version supplied to me by a friend, and I bought a lovely little USB to PSX/N64 adaptor to enjoy it with.</p>
	<p>I remember playing it a lot, but I never actually got around to playing it on the N64 until now. With a plucky enthusiasm to replay it entirely before it gets remastered, I fired it up a couple of weeks ago and took it for a spin.</p>

	<h4>Skate or Die</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The first things I noticed were the controls and the pace. While the N64 controller is ace, I found it tougher to use as a single analogue stick device than I ever did with dual analogue controllers. It also seems a little zippier than the previous games, and as a result, the draw distance is more apparent when barrelling around. I also like how each character feels unique due to their individual skill-point spread.</p>
	<p>The N64 version upcycled THPS2's Apocalypse engine, so it has this strange juxtaposed feeling of THPS2's look and feel with these new mechanics tacked on. The N64 and PSX port did, however, manage to get the exclusive "Downhill" level, but missed out on four full levels that appeared in the GC, PS2 and PC versions. Notably, the Xbox also got a bonus "Oil Rig" level.</p>

	<p>Pulling tricks feels like it has a little steeper learning curve on the N64 compared to the PlayStation controller because some buttons do nothing and others do everything. Granted, I last played THPS1+2 remastered on PS5 a couple of years ago, but I definitely struggled with the N64 controller, especially when it came to grind tricks. It's also odd that the B button and Z trigger do absolutely nothing. Regardless, once I had a firm grasp of the layout, I was back in the game and knocking out medals and high scores after half an hour or so.</p>
	<p><i>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</i> also had a couple of new tricks up its sleeves; it was the first game to feature female characters, it had a full skatepark editor, and it introduced the "Revert", a way of extending combos far beyond anything possible in the previous games when using the vert ramps. The skatepark editor is particularly notable too, because it expands the replayability of this title to unlimited proportions; the only limit is your creativity.</p>

	<h4>Grinding Gears</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Graphically, the N64 wasn't the strongest console for a game such as this, but Neversoft and Activision certainly pushed the console to get this game on there. As a result of the game straddling generations, a few compromises had to be made, so the N64 version features fewer characters and less levels than its next-gen counterparts. Levels retain the majority of their look and feel, but notably, L.A. and Skater Island are slightly cut down to fit on the cart.</p>
	<p>There are also just six music tracks in this iteration of the game. The tracks "If You Must" by Del the Funky Homosapien, "Ace of Spades" by Mot√∂rhead, "Cut Chemist Suite" by Ozomatli, "Not The Same" by Bodyjar, my personal favourite, Alien Ant Farm's "Wish", and the fully recognisable "Blitzkrieg Bop" by The Ramones are selectable at any point on any level, but it's just not enough. For comparison, the PS1 version had 12 tracks, and the PC/GC/PS2 versions have 20 tracks!</p>

	<p>The one thing that is entirely missing is the FMV cutscenes. Whereas the other version contains movies, music videos, and action/comedic scenes, the N64 version couldn't manage to fit them in, so they were completely omitted. It's a shame, but at the end of the day, at least they got the skating, combos, collectables, upgrades, multiplayer and WOLVERINE shoehorned in.</p>
	<p>The secret character you earn by completing career mode, not onece, but twice, is none other than Marvels Wolverine! Logan is the second Marvel character to appear in a THPS game, as Spider-Man appeared in THPS2 one year earlier. You can also unlock Officer Dick too by collecting 30 tapes in career mode.</p>
	<p>I'm glad I gave THPS3 another shot before the remaster arrives on July 11th because it has served to reaffirm the love I have for the original games. I still think that THPS2 has the edge over 3 for me personally, purely because it was of my era, and I absolutely played the living heck out of it on PSX back in the day.</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>9 superb levels.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>13 characters and 2 more to unlock.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>A full-featured skate park editor.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Masses of multiplayer replayability.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>USA exclusive.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Zero FMV sequences.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Missing 4 levels.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Only 6 music tracks.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p><i>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</i> for the N64 is not the best version of the game to exist by a long chalk, but it does deliver fast-paced skating action with lots to unlock and collect, and it's addictively playable.</p>
	<p>It's a shame that the game wasn't given an updated engine to utilise on the N64, but being that it was the final cartridge ever released for the N64, we should count ourselves lucky that we got a version this good at all.</p>
	<p>I don't think it deserves the 9/10 average the game scored back in the day, but it's a strong 8/10 for me!</p>
