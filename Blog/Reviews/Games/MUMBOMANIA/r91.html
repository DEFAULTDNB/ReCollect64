	<h4>Am I Dreaming?</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>If you had said to me in Y2K that in less than 25 years we would live in a world where <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> is owned by the nerds behind Windows 2000 and that the IP is lying dormant, I would probably have told you to talk to the hand, because the face isn't listening!</p>
	<p>Sadly, this is our world, but at least fans of the bear and bird duo have something great to say about it. Enter Eupholace games, headed by William Butkevicius, a professional level designer at Moon Studios. He and his team (PieceOfCraft and Duckenomics) have poured around 14 months (800 man hours) into Dreams, a game creation tool based on the Sony PlayStation 4/5 console, to build a spin-off sequel of sorts, and my goodness, does it look fantastic!</p> 
	<p><i>Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania</i> was released on the 3rd of December, 2025, and has since been updated (V1.4 at the time of writing) with various quality-of-life updates and adjustments that improve overall playability. I initially played and completed the V1.0 release within days of its release; however, it's only now that the holiday festivities are out of the way that I have time to write down my thoughts about it!</p>

	<h4>Tooled Up</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>First things first, let me say that in the past I did mess about with Dreams for PS4 and PSVR, but sadly my ability to make anything worthwhile was cut short due to my inability to devote anywhere near enough time to it. It's an amazing set of tools made by Media Molecule, the team behind Sackboy and <i>Little Big Planet</i>, that gives you unlimited freedom to create and craft anything you can envisage and build it into a tangible game or experience.</p>
	<p>Eupholace, PieceOfCraft and Duckenomics have been slaving over this project, as well as collaborating with various other creators, to produce one of the most polished Dreams ever seen. The project has garnered over 1 years worth of time played in less than a month, and it has had over 27k plays from +14k individual players, has more than 10k thumbs ups and has now been used by 29 additional projects.</p>
	<p>The game's premise is that Mumbo has lost his body, and the duo set out to Treasure Trove Cove in order to help him find it. Being a one level proof-of-concept demonstration of Eupholace Games' love letter to the <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> series, the story isn't overly cinematic or climactic, but that really doesn't have any bearing on just how incredible this creation is.</p>

	<h4>Platforming Perfection</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With 3D exploration and adventuring at its core, Mumbomania takes the tried and trusted formula of platforming and collecting copious amounts of items and runs with it. Throughout the game you need to solve puzzles, out smart enemies, and collect every jiggy, Jinjo and musical note in order to progress.</p>
	<p>Along with this, you need to encounter certain enemy types and duplicate their traits thanks to the power of Mumbo's transformation skills. There are five transformations to discover, and each requires you to have enough jigsaw pieces to unlock them. Once you have the ability unlocked, you can deploy the skill at any time, as long as you have enough juice in the magic meter.</p>
	<p>I found it captivating attempting to find uses for each transformation, and it was satisfying to experiment with all the combinations. For example, being a Plonk, you can sink under water safely, but you cannot manoeuvre easily, so you need to use the teeny-weeny little rolling rock transformation to speed about and moon jump around with an enhanced freedom of movement and momentum. Conversely, using the cannon transformation, you can fire yourself across the map into new areas, destroy certain obstacles, or just use your newfound heft to weigh things down; it's all cleverly devised!</p>
	<p>Throughout the journey, there are time-based, observation-based, and skill-based puzzles to pit your wits against, and they're a nice mixture of nostalgic callbacks and tricky new trials to solve. Overall, there is a small learning curve, especially for the checkpoint racing mini-games, but nothing will leave you stumped for more than a couple of attempts, which makes the game all the more enjoyable.</p>

	<h4>Boss Battle Blues</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The scenery, effects, enemies, objects and atmosphere throughout are incredible. The fact that a creation tool was used to make assets, which were then rigged, animated, and then had trigger points, paths, and AI implemented, and that this entire game was built within this tool alone, constantly impresses me. The way the team has lovingly crafted each aspect, fastidiously building something instantly recognisable as a <i>BK</i> game, yet maintaining a fresh and inviting appeal, is something quite special.</p>
	<p>The scale of Treasure Trove Cove is impressive; it's huge. From the towering cliffs with a lighthouse sitting atop its heights to the depths of the sea that are  protected by a palpitation-inducing guardian, a massive sense of freedom to explore is granted to you, and the density of things to look at and discover is perfectly balanced and evenly distributed so that no area feels devoid of attention or incomplete.</p>
	<p>I enjoyed the natural progression from the shore of the beach, through the caves, across the waterways and eventually up to the top of the map and beneath the surface of the seas. The adventuring elements feel organic and consistently give you reasons to explore further or change direction and search for something new. It took me around solid two hours to 100% complete everything, and I adored every second of it!</p>
	<p>If I had to grumble, I would say that the only thing missing is a decent boss battle. We meet some great NPCs, but none really give off a dark, sinister, evil energy that properly juxtaposes the seaside tropical feels. Perhaps the creators have more in mind and will look to expand the story and levels further in the future? One can only hope!</p>
