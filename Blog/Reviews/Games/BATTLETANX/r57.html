	<h4>Tanked Up</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>BattleTanx</i> by 3DO is a post-apocalyptic blast-em-up set in 2001, where you play as Griffin Spade, a warrior and battle leader who must wage war to protect his fianc√©e, Madison. The apocalypse, which began with the X2 virus that only affects the female populace, swept America and turned it into a radioactive wasteland.</p>
	<p>Across America, 99.9% of infected women were perishing, so the government declared martial law and attempted to evacuate any surviving women in a bid to prevent the plight of the human race. Armed with lethal force, the army was allowed to crush any male opposition to this plan. With coups and uprisings, the military chain of command became fractured, and civil war erupts with the protection of people's famlies being the driving catalyst to fight back. Oh, and China invades Russia.</p>
	<p>The story is naff and makes little sense, but the gameplay is genuinely badass. At its core, you drive tanks around and blow everything up. It's compelling and fun!</p>

	<h4>Explosively Engaging</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With campaign, annihilation, battlelord, deathmatch, and family modes, <i>BattleTanx</i> really has something for everyone. The campaign consists of 13 main missions plus four bonus missions where you destroy as many tanks as possible in an allotted time. The main objective of the game is to traverse the country from Ground Zero to the Q-Zone, with the goal of rescuing Madison and any other queen lords (women) you encounter during your journey.</p>
	<p>There are 15 power-ups that range from cloaking to nukes, mines to swarm missiles, lasers and grenades, radar, health and points perks. You can even set up gun buddies to fortify your base. I really enjoy the range of options there are to decimate your opponents, and the explosions and destruction have a graphical quality about them that I really like. I still don't really understand the purpose of collecting points. I suppose it's a metagame, for bragging rights?</p>

	<p>Nostalgicly, the campaign uses a password system to let you jump back into whichever level you wish, and there are a plethora of cheatcodes hidden in there too:</p>

	<h4>Off the Rails</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>While the game is decent in single-player mode, it's the multiplayer modes that deliver the most entertainment value because of the utter chaos that usually ensues.</p>	
	<p>Deathmatch is the first to seven kills, annihilation is last tank standing, and battlelord is effectively capture the flag with queen lords. Family mode is an odd one. It simplifies the gameplay down to one-button firing and automatically selects weapons for you. I'm not a fan of this mode at all, but I can see how it would make for a good gateway game for new players to pick the game up for the first time.</p>
	<p>Within multiplayer, you get to choose from Griffins Army, Urban Decay, Charlie Company, After Shocks, Dark Angels, Nuclear Knights, Mech Maniacs, Skull Riderz and Psycho Brigade as your team, and one of eight locations spanning the United States as your arena of destruction. From New York's Times Square to Area 51, the locations have varied layouts but similar scales to them overall.</p>
	<p>Each level has backstreets, hidden warehouses, and destructible scenery where you can forge a path through the arena as you wish. The only issue is the radar. As soon as one of you has the radar, it's game over for the rest, as you'll know exactly where to go to blast your foes. The main modes also allow for all-vs-all or team-based gameplay, though keeping the teams even is the fairest way to play, because 3-vs-1 is extremely tough unless you're an absolute battlelord!</p>
	<p>I'm a huge fan of this game's replayability within the multiplayer modes. If you consider that this came out in 1998, destruction and explosive gameplay like this was almost unheard of, especially on a Nintendo console. It was, and remains, incredibly playable even to this day.</p>

	<p>Having replayed it now, I would say that the graphics are still decent, albeit muddy and blurry in places, and the "lighting" is extremely dark in most levels. I much prefer the daytime or more vibrantly coloured levels, like Area 51 or Las Vegas, as the draw distance is unforgiving in the murky shadows of the trademark N64 fog.</p>
	<div class="col-container">
	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Plenty of modes for up to 4 players.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Masses of deathmatch replayability.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Destructible scenery is a blast!</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>A USA exclusive for some reason.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Repetitive music, no voices and limited sfx.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Single player is not as fun as multiplayer.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p><i>BattleTanx</i> is a game that I spent a lot of time with back in the day. I loved the variety of campaign levels and multiplayer modes mixed with the power-ups and carnage.</p>
	<p>You need to play with other players to escalate the fun, as the campaign can feel quite low energy when playing alone.</p>
