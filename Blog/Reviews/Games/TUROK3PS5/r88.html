	<p><i>Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion</i> is the third game in the titular Turok franchise and the last FPS adventure on the Nintendo 64. Nightdive's 2023 remaster of the game brings all the usual modernities as well as uprezzed graphics and silky frame rates thanks to the KEX engine it's built within.</p>
	<p>For some reason, the third game always eluded me. It didn't quite have the same feel, and running in low resolution on the OG N64 hardware, I always struggled with the night vision sections, getting crushingly bad migraines and never wanting to return to them. Let's see how I fare in HD!</p>

	<h4>Half-Baked</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>Turok 3</i> is the first game in the series to give you the choice of two characters, Danielle Fireseed, a 27-year-old widow or Joseph Fireseed, a 14-year-old future Turok, with haunting dreams about protecting children, and a crush on Adon, I think. If I'm honest, the story is so throwaway that it has relatively little bearing on the action that awaits you. Essentially Oblivion wants to end the Turok lineage, and the Fireseed child that needs protecting is actually <b>*SPOILER ALERT*</b> Danielle's unborn baby!</p>
	<p>Depending on which protagonist you pick, you are privy to different weapons, story beats, and paths through the levels. Whereas Joshua is more stealthy with a blade, night vision goggles and a sniper rifle, Danielle is more brute-like, specialising in heavier firepower, with weapons including the Tomahawk, energy grapple, Cerebral Burst, and Fireswarm.</p>
	<p>There are effectively 26 weapons and gadgets to use, but I typically opted for the trusty Shotgun/Shredder/Fireswarm or assault rifle for my main grunt hunting, and a grenade launcher/RPG/napalm cannon as my heavy artillery against bigger or multiple threats. Notable weapons include the Cerebral Bore's variants, the burst and the possessor. The latter allows you to control any enemy it's been drilled into the skull of for a limited time.</p>
	<p>Interestingly, you collect parts of the Personal Singularity Generator weapon throughout the game, but if you fail to find one and progress, you cannot go back and get that piece ever again. I don't get what the dev's were thinking with this oversight. Atleast in the previous games you could warp back to previous levels to rectify these issues.</p>

	<p>The majority of the game is spent running, solving some extremely light puzzle elements, and proceeding to the next area. Whereas the previous titles seemed to have more of an explorative adventure style to their twisty maze-like areas, this is more of a run-and-gun game with an urban aesthetic and less difficult-to-navigate terrain.</p>
	<p>Enemies in this game range from patrolling S.W.A.T. teams to possessed dogs, the occasional raptor here and there, but mainly demonic entities like Stryders and "Lost ones" that wouldn't feel out of place in a <i>Shadow Man</i> title. The zombie-like humans also lean into the <i>Half-Life</i>-like headcrab vibe, but they're so sparse you never feel overwhelmed or like you can't put some space between yourself and the danger to get back on top of killing them all. There are 26 enemies in total, but none are particularly incredible, and some pose very little threat whatsoever.</p>
	<p>Each of the five chapters has a cartoony-feeling boss fight within a closed off arena. I found them all extremely straight forward to deal with until you get to the last boss. Each one can be taken down by simply firing and strafing around them and then hitting whetever environmental cue once they're circling the drain. The bosses are big and bold and less grindy than the previous games, but they're not particularly taxing or noteworthy, until you meet Joshua Fireseed, that is. That part was definitely a highlight where my interest piqued.</p>
	<p>Overall, this game is definitely nowhere near as difficult as the ones that came before it, but if you get stuck, then here is a selection of cheats to help you through. Just remember that popping trophies will be disabled with these enabled:</p>

	<h4>Out Gunned</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I love the dynamic look of the levels and characters in this game, and as the third game in the trilogy, it definitely seems to push the N64 to its limits by adding in neat effects like the night vision toggle and keeping a steadier frame rates while also reducing the series' staple fog.</p>
	<p>The style of this game appears more refined and more honed, looking more like an early PC or GameCube title, but it somehow comes across as less exciting and less true to the previous entries. Perhaps it's the art direction, perhaps it's a destinct lack of dinosaurs, or perhaps it's just that this final game adheres to the comics more than tying in with the first two games. I don't know, I have never read the comics.</p>
	<p>Nightdive Studio's KEX engine is certainly a miraculous tool in making the <i>Turok</i> trilogy more appealing 25-28 years after their first releases, and this remaster is no exception. The framerate never falters and the onscreen action is exceptionally crisp and clear from the beginning through to the end. The loading of each area is almost instant on my PS5 Pro, and the advanced lighting effects go a long way to make the game feel more atmospheric and alive.</p>
	<p>I did feel that the gyro controls in this version were particularly oversensitive, and the bob and sway felt far more distracting than in the other games. I had to tone them down and in some instances turn them off to get the best out of the movement without feeling too rough while playing. You'll be glad to hear that the increased resolution also makes the two night vision sections far more palatable too.</p>

	<p>At this point in my previous review for <i>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</i>, I was pondering if the third game would also be an unprecedented smash. I honestly don't think this threequel has the same feel, and thus it comes off as an underwhelming end to the trilogy. To rub it in, it also sets you up for a fourth game featuring Yvree after Adon rage quits, which sadly never got made.</p>
	<p><i>Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion</i> is a great first-person shooter that plainly borrows from its peers rather than eking out its own path as its predecessors once did. It has some wonderful cinematics and some really nice nostalgic levels that clone the instantly recognisable opening area from <i>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</i>, but overall it all feels less inventive and more like the team wanted to make a game more akin to <i>Half-Life</i> than to <i>Turok 2</i>.</p>
	<div class="col-container">
	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Choice of two characters (alternate weapons).<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>More cinematic quality than the previous two games.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Spacious, less maze-like, levels.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Modern controls and visuals are outstanding.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Significantly shorter game.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Just 5 levels with 5 basic bosses.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>No way to go back to a level if you miss something.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>NO MULTIPLAYER WHATSOEVER.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>Nightdive has a proven track record of producing beautiful remasters, but this one feels slightly shortchanged in terms of content. I romped each playthrough of the game in under three hours each and discovered that there was zero multiplayer action or additional content to be had outside of the main campaign. What a misstep!</p>
	<p><i>Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion</i> remains my least favourite of the series, but it definitely looks and plays much better on modern consoles than it ever did on the N64. It's 100% worth a play, but don't expect to be blown away.</p>
