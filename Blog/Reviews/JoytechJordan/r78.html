	<h4>Turning Point</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>By the late 90s, there were numerous steering wheels that were compatible with the Nintendo 64. Joytech, known for their controllers and memory cards, were already elbow deep in the N64, but instead of making something purely for one console, they opted to bring hybrid connectivity to both Nintendo's N64 and Sony's PlayStation console.</p>
	<p>Joytech's <i>Jordan Grand Prix Wheel II</i>, as the name implies, is the sequel revision of their initial racing wheel, which added Nintendo 64 functionality through a 2-in-1 plug, as well as refined authenticity in terms of comfort and quality.</p>
	<p>This model features a fully 180-degree self-centring wheel, 13 buttons including 4 on the paddles, a two-way gear stick, full analogue pedals and a built-in rumble motor, which requires 4xAA batteries. It's a high-end wheel for the time, and the collaboration with a racing giant such as Jordan means that you know it's going to be awesome!</p>

	<h4>More Hit Than Miss</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Firing up <i>AeroGauge</i>, I thought I would test this wheel against a slightly different selection of games to truly get to grips with it. <i>AeroGauge</i> offers 3D flying/racing, and this wheel automatically sets the left pedal to ascend and the right to descend, meaning you're controlling the steering and acceleration with the wheel but the height of your vehicle with the pedals, which allow for full analogue control!</p>
	<p>I have to admit, the turning responsiveness and comfortable grip of this wheel are top-notch. I felt like I was in an arcade playing on a solid piece of hardware, and the comfort and relatively low learning curve were brilliant to jump into. Trying out <i>World Driver Championship, GT 64 Championship Edition, F1 World Grand Prix</i>, and <i>F1 Pole Position</i>, I found that the games are rock-bloody solid to beat; however, the feeling of being behind an F1-style wheel definitely amps up the overall immersion of taking part in high-spec racing simulations.</p>
	<p><i>F1 Pole Position 64</i> would not start at all with this wheel connected, because it was detected as having a rumble pack connected. Even removing the batteries would not solve the issue. Regardless, the rumble function is great in games that support it, and oddly, the socket does support memory paks as well as rumble paks.</p>
	<p>Through sheer determination, I managed to figure out that pressing MODE + B would give you A for accelerate, B for brake and L/R mapped as up and down on the gear stick. Alternatively, pressing MODE + A maps Z to the left pedal, R to the right, and A and B act as 'gear up' and 'gear down' respectively. There are also modes for MODE + C-Up and MODE + C-Down, but they keep the analogue up and down on the pedals, which I want to reiterate: works brilliantly for <i>AeroGauge</i>.</p>
	<p>Traditional racing titles, such as <i>Diddy Kong Racing, Extreme-G, F-Zero</i> and <i>Mario Kart 64</i>, require B mode so that you have the correct buttons under your feet. Speaking of which, the pedals have small grips to hold them in place, but it doesn't work at all on carpets, leading you to scoot around attempting to keep them in the vicinity of your feet.</p>

	<h4>Stick Around</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Games that require stick shifting, like <i>Top Gear Rally</i> or <i>GT 64</i>, for example, feel great when in the correct mode. The sensation of flicking through the gears accentuates the arcade feel of the games with a wheel in hand. The immersion ramps up, and the endorphins kick in far more so than when playing with a paltry controller.</p>
	<p>One weird oddity was that the memory pak slot wasn't marked as such and had a plastic cover over it that felt like it hadn't been removed since it was put together in the factory. I had to lever the thing out with an implement to locate the socket before I could use it. I thought it quite user-unfriendly, as with the lack of instruction on the wheel itself.</p>
	<p>For the princely sum of £2 that this wheel and pedals cost me (£59.99 RRP at release), I cannot complain about the build quality or the functionality, but it would have been great to fully configure this for any game with a nice set of instructions.</p>
	<div class="col-container">
	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Two excellent sensitivity options.<br>

	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Extremely smooth and authentic feeling.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Four mode options for setting up various racing games.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Force feedback motor and mem/rumble pak slot built-in.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Works on PS1 and PS2 as well!</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Not working with F1 Pole Position for some reason.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Why not print instructions on the underside?<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>The pedals need to be stuck down on carpets.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>Joytech's <i>Jordan Grand Prix Wheel II</i> is undisputedly one of the best wheels on the system. Once you figure out the correct modes, you can have an absolute blast in almost all games on the system!</p>
