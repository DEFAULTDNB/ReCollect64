	<h4>Substance over Style</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Nintendo 64 controllers came in many different shapes and forms, but most adhere to a basic style guide of a symmetrical design, 10 buttons, one analogue stick and a d-pad. With this in mind, the almost brandless "3D2" controller I have before me looks like a prototype of the OEM controller, using 32-bit-era grey plastic and a round, yes, round gate?!?</p>
	<p>There are very few of these available to buy online, many with snapped-off and missing d-pads, and even less tangible information as to who exactly made this thing. The reason for this is probably that they're embarrassed at being responsible for this thing, and they've scrubbed the internet and gone into hiding.</p>

	<h4>Load of Shtick</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The first thing you notice when holding this is that the analogue stick has no grip, it's rather large, and it has an unorthodoxly circular gate. The lack of grip comes into play almost immediately, with your thumb scrambling for purchase on any edge you can eke out. Though the size allows your thumb to locate it quickly, it feels flat as a pancake and won't win any innovation prizes.</p>
	<p>With a circular gate, this thing was born to have issues, and surprisingly enough, it does. The feel is anything but smooth, and the upper diagonals have largely vanished, they are long gone, which is easily verified by the Mimi pad testing benchmarks. I ran this thing 5 times to get an average, and all I ended up with was a Spirograph looking doodle.</p>
	<p>Technically, the U, D, L, and R directions register perfectly, but anything else will leave you asking yourself, "How did this pass QA testing?" The answer is, it probably never had any amount of expertise thrown at it, because this thing is utterly awful.</p>

	<h4>Never Mind the B*tt*ns</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The "32D Turbo" also sports a strangely circular d-pad and scaled-down buttons, but guess what? They're equally bland and nondescript! None of them feel nice, none of them have any tactile depth, and all of them have a slippery complexion. The shoulder and trigger buttons are present and correct, and work fine, I guess, but they are lacking something in terms of refinement. They don't click; rather, they clack and clatter unconvincingly.</p>
	<p>We have the main 6 face buttons too, but they're slightly smaller than you would expect, meaning you constantly ghost your fingers over multiple buttons. The start button is also tiny and offset to the left, just out of reach, which is painfully badly to locate. All of this is encapsulated in a stubby version of the trident grips, which, for all my good nature, I cannot find any other words, than to express that it feels like you're awkwardly manhandling rock-solid tepid dog shit.</p>
	<p>The controller also has turbo and slow-motion features, which is a bonus, but why you would want to engage with this controller for more time than you had to is beyond me. Ultimately you won't even bother switching them on, because overall, the pad is atrocious and will quickly find its way into the bin before you attempt to use it for any serious gameplay.</p>

	<p>The 3D2 is absolute trash. If you ever had the displeasure of owning one of these you may be entitled to compensation as an adult. It's that bad, I'm giving it a 1/10.</p>
