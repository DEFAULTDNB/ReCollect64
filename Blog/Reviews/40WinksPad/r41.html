	<h4>Roughly Tumbled</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When <i>40 Winks</i> was released by Piko Interactive via Kickstarter in 2018, they laid out some nice-sounding stretch goals. The main one I will focus on, because it is the most relevant to this review, is the promised <i>40 Winks</i>-themed controller.</p>
	<p>As I mentioned in my feature on <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b53">Prototype Games back in December</a>, I was aghast at just how the promised controller differed from the actual controller that eventually got released. Now, I'm not a total fool, I know that Nintendo owns the OEM controller shape and therefore would  NOT be the final shape of the controller, but Piko never updated their promotional material, and the final result couldn't have been further from that appealing design.</p>
	<p>Having picked one up recently with a copy of the game, which I reviewed earlier this week, I can tell you that even for a nominal price, this thing absolutely, and without any form of redemption, sucks balls.</p>

	<p>What is the first thing you noticed about this controller?</p>
	<p>This Tomee brand controller, was recoloured and rebranded to fit the <i>40 Winks</i> merchandising. Positively speaking, the colouring is nice and vibrant, and the logo is clear and prominent; however, look at the lack of labelling on the three top buttons. For some unknown reason, the manufacturers neglected to put "Slow/Turbo/Clear" on those additional buttons, leaving them completely blank.</p>
	<p>The ergonomic form of the controller is chopped down. The handles are gone, replaced with ball-like grips on the rear that you struggle to hold onto during gameplay. Any level of comfort has been hacked out of the OEM design in favour of cheapness. I genuinely couldn't hate these design choices more.</p>
	<p>The stick feels nice at first. It has a great snap back to centre. The person I bought this from listed it as never used, which I believe because it has no signs of wear whatsoever. The other reason I believe them is that the stick is horribly calibrated and has an unnervingly crunchy sound about its actions.</p>
	<p>Who would willingly choose to use a controller like that?</p>

	<h4>Out of Control(ler)</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Running checks on the stick's directional limits, it's not a good result. With a vertical range of 79 to -92 and a horizontal of -76 to 101, there is a massive issue on the right-hand side and the bottom of the unit. The controller doesn't appear to act-up in game, but based on these scores, it is less than impressive.</p>
	<p>Having benchmarked it, I had to give it a try in-game. Of course, I tested <i>40 Winks</i>, and <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r37">GoldenEye X V6a</a>, and I absolutely hated it. At no point did I think, "Hey, this is ok!", instead I kept wincing and worrying that I was grinding the stick to pieces within.</p>
	<p>This has to be one of the worst controllers I have laid hands on, and having <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#HallOfFame">reviewed 11 input devices</a> for the N64 previously, this is alongside the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r17">Logic3 6T4 Pad</a> in terms of general awfulness.</p>

	<p>Though I love the colour and transparency, it's not enough to make up for the heinous design language, horrible feel, terrible stick, and overall suckiness of this pad. It feels like no thought has gone into this. It has simply been chosen by Piko as a super cheap thing to give away after achieving 60,000 backers, minimizing outlay, and maximising profits. I would have been fuming had I been a backer. I'm seriously glad I didn't.</p>
	<p>Any redeeming features might include the additional turbo and slow functions, but even they have half-assed. Overall, this thing is a cheap-feeling piece of tat that is undeserving of ever being plugged into a console.</p>

	<p>Collectors might dive on this, as I did, but true players should avoid this, and by extension, the Tomee controllers, at all costs. This is not worth the plastic it's been moulded with.</p>

	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>I was so disappointed when this piece of crap was released compared to the announced images. Piko Interactive really did everyone dirty with this rubbish. If you really have to buy one, from a collector's standpoint, please don't bother using it.</p>
