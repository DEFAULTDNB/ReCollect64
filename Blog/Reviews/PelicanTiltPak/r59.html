	<h4>Tipping Point</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When the N64 released in 1996, no one could have predicted that gyroscopic controls would become a staple of modern gaming. What seemed like a gimmick a decade before actually became a core feature of Nintendo's Wii console in 2006.</p>
	<p>Where most motion controllers were extremely primitive tilt sensors, some companies, such as Pelican, actually refined the technology and produced quality peripherals that added incredible new functionality to existing hardware. The Pelican Tilt Pak, or "Trumble Pak" as they like to refer to it, is a marvel of engineering that, through the addition of a plug-in pak and dongle, adds full-fledged motion controls to any controller and any game you wish!</p>
	<p>Simply plug the dongle between the console and the controller cable, insert the pak and you're away. Had I known about this device in the 90s, I would have totally wanted one of these, but I had no clue it even existed until relatively recently.</p>

	<h4>Balanced Brilliance</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Setting up the device is very straightforward if you have the instructions and the all-essential dongle. Fortunately, when I bought mine in April, it came fully bundled with all parts and the instruction manual included.</p>
	<p>The Trumble pak has a selector on the left, as you look at it, for off/medium/high rumble intensity and two buttons on the right for setting up the turbo fire modes and configuring the tilt sensors. Incidentally, setting the Start button to turbo allows for slow-mo too, but who the hell uses that anyway?</p>
	<p>With two AA batteries inserted, the dongle connected, a game inserted, the console powered on and the controller ready to rumble, as it were, you turn the tilt functionality on by way of pressing Start+L+R at any point in or before your game starts. This in-game button combo allows you to toggle it on and off at any point, should you wish to revert to the ancient old-school stick controls. Eurgh.</p>
	<p>Using the set button, you can program an "at rest" position, also known as the angle you typically tend to hold your controller at, as a baseline for the sensor to operate with. Using the C-Buttons while in "set" mode, you can adjust the left/right/up/down sensitivity and even invert the controls.</p>

	</ul>
	<p><b>SET UP:</b></p>
    <ul>
		<li>Place two AAA batteries into the "trumble" battery compartment (note: tilt will function without batteries; however rumble will not)</li>
		<li>Turn off your N64 console</li>
		<li>Plug the "dongle" in between the control plug and N64 console</li>
		<li>Insert the "trumble" into the slot in your Nintendo64 controller (note: the dongle must be in place before the "trumble" is inserted for the tilt feature to work).</li>
		<li>Turn on your N64 console, a red light will light up in the "dongle" indicating it is functioning properly.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>BASIC OPERATION:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>To Turn Tilt On/Off = L + R + Start</li>
		<li>To Turbo a Button = press desired button - then press turbo (the yellow light will flash).</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>CONFIGURATION MODE:</b></p>
	<p>Press the Set button on the "trumble" to enter configuration mode (the green light below the set button will begin to flash), when finished, press again to exit (the green light will go off)</p>
	<p>Reducing or Increasing Range of Pad Movement:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>D-Up: Increase up/down movement</li>
		<li>D-Left: Decrease left/right movement</li>
		<li>D-Right: Increase left/right movement</li>
		<li>D-Down: Decrease up/down movement</li>
	</ul>
    <p>NOTE: by pressing multiple times you will continue to increase or decrease the range of movement incrementally</p>
    <ul>
		<li>C-Up: Reverse movement</li>
		<li>C-Left/Right: Decrease left/right sensitivity</li>
		<li>C-Down: Increase up/down sensitivity</li>
	</ul>
    <p>NOTE: press only once</p>
    <ul>
		<li>Set "At Rest" Position: Hold pad at desired resting position/angle, then press Z</li>
		<li>Save New Setings as Default: L + R</li>
		<li>Restore all Factory Defaults: Start</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>GAME PLAY HINTS:</b></p>
    <p>In Racing and Flight you may desire to adjust your range of pad movement (set mode using the D pad). This will correct oversteer and understeer tendencies in the game. Another option would be to adjust the sensitivity (set mode, C Left or C Down)</p>
    <p>Adventure games, i.e., Mario 64, may be enhanced by decreasing your range of pad movement (set mode, D pad Left or D pad Down).</p>
    <p>For best game play hold your pad by the two outside handles and use your middle finger to operate the Z (Trigger Button). This will give you better fire button control. When playing a racing game, hold your controller in a vertical position like a racing wheel for a more realistic experience.</p>

	<h4>Gyroscopic Greatness</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I wouldn't have expected this to work as well as it did, and honestly, it works superbly. The integration is so seamless and so well implemented that it's astonishing that Nintendo didn't do this themselves. I also like how it's not just for analogue stick-based games; you can also use it, and calibrate it, for D-Pad-forward games too, giving them a fresh feel with gyro controls.</p>
	<p>The feel is so smooth and so accurate that you quickly forget it's an accessory. You find yourself immersed further into your games, somehow with more freedom thanks to the improved playstyle the motion sensing affords you. It's tough to express how elegantly it melds together with any OEM controller or any third-party pad. It's effortlessly fantastic to steer and swoop around with.</p>
	<p>Platform games like <i>Super Mario 64</i> or <i>Gex</i> require the calibration to be set to a lower sensitivity for precision, but racing games and flight sims like <i>Diddy Kong Racing, Mario Kart 64, Aero Fighters Assault</i> and <i>Lylat Wars</i> need it cranked right up for more reactive controls. The best thing is it's super simple to recalibrate, on the fly, with very little hassle whatsoever.</p>
	<p>It's a shame there aren't on-board programmable profiles, as switching genres would be even quicker. I also probably wouldn't use this for shooters like <i>GoldenEye 007</i> or <i>Perfect Dark</i>, but for platforming, flight and even racing games, this accessory is an absolute hoot!</p>

	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>The Pelican Trumble "Tilt" Pak breaks my brain with it's functionality, but it works a treat. These things should have been far more widely known about than they are!</p>
