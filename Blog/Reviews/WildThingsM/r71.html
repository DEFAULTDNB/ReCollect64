	<h4>Definite "Thing"</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Nintendo 64 controllers come in all shapes and forms, and as such, not all controllers were made equal. The main gist of third-party controller manufacturing etiquette is that no controller should be the exact same shape or style as the original, licensed offering from Nintendo.</p>
	<p>Most 64-based controllers of the late 90s exhibited strange and often garish aesthetics that dared challenge the established beauty, style and comfort of the OEM controller. As a result we got things like this, the Wild Things Mirage controller, which is as painful to look at as it is to use.</p>
	<p>Thanks to this controller having zero markings and no name scrawled on it anywhere, I had to spend some time working out exactly what this controller was. Thanks to the power of Google's reverse image search, I uploaded a photo I took, and one result came back from Facebook, also without a name. Luckily I remembered that <a href="https://x.com/WaveRace64/status/1806449081239179634">Wave Race 64 Official on Twitter/X.com</a> occasionally rants about controllers with the hashtag "RateMyPad", and lo and behold, I found a gold version of this controller, which allowed me to subsequently confirm the make and model of this controller.</p>

	<h4>Flat and Bland</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The Nintendo 64 ushered in a world of 3D environments and gameplay, and the analogue stick, and by extension the controller, mirrored this paradigm shift. Wild Things, a Chinese company that made controllers and accessories for consoles such as the PS1/PS2, Sega Saturn and N64, sought to eke out their own niche with abstract-looking controllers that vaguely resemble their peers.</p>
	<p>The Mirage controller for the Nintendo 64 is one such device that exudes fugliness and feels absolutely horrible in your hands. It's so flat-looking that it's almost two-dimensional, and its poor ergonomics and aesthetics really do set it apart - in a bad way.</p>
	<p>Gripping the controller, you feel the cumbersomely chunky plastic handles wrap around the back. They're ok to hold onto, but not massively comfortable. The triggers on the L and R are heinous too. They're little curved, square versions of the Z-trigger, which I do not prefer compared to proper shoulder bumpers.</p>
	<p>The D-Pad is technically responsive and clicky but has an unpleasant feel underlying its rugged exterior, and the buttons are equally responsive but tactilely bland and rub your fingers raw during frantic gameplay.</p>

	<h4>Stick Redemption, but..</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>You would be forgiven for thinking that the stick on this has been ripped straight out of a first-party controller; it's that decent. The stick bears an uncanny resemblance, though is flatter on the top. The gate is identical; it even feels the same and reacts the same in-game.</p>
	<p>With shooting games and flying simulations, it performed well, better than expected, to be honest, but then, all of a sudden, the controller conked out. I have no idea of there is a short somewhere or a sketchy wire in the cord, but something is now preventing it from working at all.</p>
	<p>Regardless, I only paid £5 for it, and I managed to eke out a somewhat decent review session with it before it gave up the ghost. Sadly I couldn't get a stick test out of it, though I don't feel that it would have been too far off of the acceptable ranges in each direction.</p>
	<p>R.I.P., little fugly controller.</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Unique styling, and transparent.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Actually has a decent stick.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Cumbersom and fugly.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Died in my arms.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>This wasn't the worst controller to grace the ReCollect64 test desk, and though it really doesn't look or feel great and the triggers and buttons are completely naff, overall, it performed well when it came to stick responsiveness.</p>
	<p>I wouldn't recommend you actively purchase one of these because there are far better pads out there. But for the £5 I spent, it was worth a look over and adding to my ongoing collection of bizarre N64 peripherals, even if it died.</p>
