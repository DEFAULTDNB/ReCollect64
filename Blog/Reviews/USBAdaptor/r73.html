	<h4>Plug & Play</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Back in around 2001 I bought my first desktop PC with my first student loan. I went all in with a 3DFX Voodoo and Sound Blaster-packed Dell Dimension that had more than enough grunt to do all my university work, as well as running games and emulators with ease!</p>
	<p>Around the same time, I recall the UltraHLE emulator being all the rage, and now, I would finally get to run it, without any risk of it exploding the borderline SNES/NES emulation-capable family PC I had left behind in London.</p>
	<p>Upon trying it out, I was in love with how well it ran <i>Super Mario 64</i>. My N64 was in storage 100+ miles from my student digs, but I wasn't satisfied with using a keyboard and mouse, so I almost immediately invested in a USB N64 adaptor, which I still own and still use to this day.</p>

	<p>This USB adaptor is relatively small at just 9cm x 7cm and is as unbranded as they come; however, I believe it was originally marketed by "Boom". It requires next to no knowledge to use adequately on today's PC hardware, but back in the day, you were supplied a driver disc/disk, and all you had to do was install the driver, plug in a controller, calibrate the stick (N64 only) and get playing.</p>
	<p>As with anything, after the hardware was recognised and you had your controller plugged in, you simply toggled the mode from PSX to N64 or vice versa. It was not possible to use both controllers at the same time, nor was it possible to use a rumble pak (or memory card), but the analogue stick versions of the PSX controller, as well as PS2 controllers, worked fine on the PSX side of things.</p>
	<p>The device set me back about £12-£15 back in 2001, which I remember thinking felt a bit steep (that's £28 adjusted for inflation in todays money), but I knew I would get a lot out of it. Turns out it's well built and extremely durable, because it's been in my possession for 24 years, and it's survived hundreds of hours of use as well as approximately 7 house moves!</p>

	<h4>Dual Heroes</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With this adaptor, every emulator and each PC game needed individual configuration to set the buttons up as you would want them, but in the early 2000s this is how it was. Bluetooth connectivity and preconfigured games were not a thing. A keyboard and mouse was king on PC, so this was a break from the norm, and it helped me transition from prior NES/SNES/PSX/N64 console gaming to comfortably playing games on a PC.</p>
	<p>Even up until recently I have been using this connector to utilise my OEM N64 controllers on my PC for use with RMG and PJ64. It works a treat, and configuration takes next to no time, thanks to the applications allowing for almost anything to work with it, storing the settings and tweaking dead zones, etc.</p>
	<p>In terms of gaming, I have never noticed any input lag or ghosting on the buttons, so I firmly believe that this adaptor remains perfect for playing PC games as well as emulated titles. I must have played the majority of the N64 library with this connector, and insane amounts of MAME and PSX games too, never finding a single fault with detection, drivers or lag.</p> 
	<p>When I started writing my Stick Tester app for my site, I had hoped that the generic connection of a controller to USB would be read universally, but I quickly found that it wasn't, as my results differed using this adaptor compared to other testers who used higher-end hardware from Raphnet, for example. Sadly, the HID input method for translating the controller socket to a USB socket and the protocols involved are not as accurately detected as, say, a Mayflash or Raphnet adaptor through raw access, so using it as a tool to capture stick benchmarks is not entirely accurate or directly comparable to others as a baseline.</p>
	<p>Regardless, this was bought for gaming, and it is still outstanding in terms of value for money (using the formula: years of ownership * hours of use / cost) and for using your OG authentic wired controllers on any 1998-2025 PC setup you might have.</p>

	<div class="col-container">
	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Simple plug and play device.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>One switch with two LED indicators.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Great to have a 2-in-1 option on one USB socket.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Works with PS2 controllers as well.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Doesn't support rumble pak.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Picky with 3rd-party N64 controllers.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Not useful for benchmarking on PC.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>Though by today's standards this adaptor is extremely primitive and antiquated, the loyalty I feel towards this inanimate piece of technology is immense due to the fun-packed history we have shared together.</p>
	<p>I will never get rid of this adaptor, but with controllers like the N64 NSO pad and the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r69">8BitDo 64 controller</a> working so easily with Bluetooth, I am gradually shifting to wireless methods of play and more modern implementations of teh N64 controller.</p>
