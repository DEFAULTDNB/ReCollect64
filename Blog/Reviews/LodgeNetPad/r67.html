	<h4>Happy Holiday Hotel</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When you go to a hotel these days, do you expect to have access to game consoles in your room? Back in the year 2000, Nintendo sought to change this expectation by rolling out LodgeNet, a pay-per-view service on which you could play anything from Game Boy to GameCube with-in your hotel room.</p>
	<p>With a receiver box and a controller in hand, it was up to you to enter your credit card information if you wanted to enjoy some leisurely gaming. LodgeNet reportedly cost upwards of $6.95 plus tax per hour, with notable N64 RPG titles on the service taking an average of 20-30 hours to complete.</p>
	<p>In certain lucky hotels, thirty-eight Nintendo 64 titles landed on the service, with a predominantly first-party line-up and a very small handful of offerings from Namco, Activision, and Midway. Here is the list of titles included:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1080Â° Snowboarding
			<li>Donkey Kong 64
			<li>Dr. Mario 64
			<li>Excitebike 64
			<li>Extreme-G

			<li>Forsaken 64

		</ul>
	<p>Sadly, I never got to experience the service firsthand, but recently, in February, I acquired a LodgeNet controller for my collection for a very reasonable price, and I finally got to check it out in person and give it a once-over in comparison to the other controllers in my collection.</p>

	<h4>Additional Adaptations</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With the pay-to-play service at the heart of the design manifest, Nintendo produced the LodgeNet controllers with extra buttons and a peculiar plug. The elephant in the room is the cluster of buttons at the top that includes the order, menu, select, reset, "#" and "*" keys.</p>
	<p>The menu key would bring up a service selection menu which allowed you to select movies, games, languages, and more. The order button would change the channel to the in-house food, beverages, and services menu. You could literally do everything from this controller, providing you with bleeding-edge entertainment and simple-to-access on-site amenities.</p>
	<p>Another quirk of this controller is the RJ11 connector on the other end of the cable. I believe this served two purposes. Firstly, the controller needed more I/O than a typical pad, what with the additional buttons requiring more physical wiring from end to end than the OEM controller. Secondly, Nintendo would not have wanted these to be stolen and used on people's consoles at home, so making the connectors entirely incompatible would cut down on any possible shrinkage involved.</p>
	<p>There are now tutorials with methods on how to convert the cable for use on a retail console, which requires soldering the PCB in a couple of locations and splicing an N64 controller port barrel onto the end. I wouldn't recommend doing this, however, as it will severely devalue the unit as a collectible piece of Nintendo 64-related history.</p>

	<h4>Server Saviours</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As a follow-up to my previous thought-explosion found <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b85">here</a>, I have discovered that the download times would not have been half as bad as I had initially imagined. With ADSL becoming a reality by 2000, 512 kbps lines doubled the speed of typical 56k download speeds at home, and with intranet and locally connected Ethernet (100BASE-T) and Gigabit Ethernet (1000BASE-T) wired rooms, the speed of transferring the game from host (within a central server, reportedly from a UNIX-based system consisting of an array of HDDs storing movies and other content) to client was probably virtually instantaneous, and therefore a complete non-issue even though the RJ11 cables and ports only manage about 24 MB/s through their 4-6 pin construction.</p>
	<p>There are two variations of this controller too, the GC stick and N64 stick versions. Though the N64 variant was proclaimed to be the tightest and most resilient rendition of the N64 stick to date, built to last in public hands, the GC variant was a tactical upgrade for Nintendo to deploy on the LodgeNet systems. The GC stick is notably more sensitive and offers a far smoother feel while minimising the chance of wear and tear making the stick loose due to a more compact and less mechanical construction.</p>

	<h4>Puzzling Pads</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>No version of the controller has rumble support, and you can't even plug one in, which is odd because a number of the supported titles have rumble-related features, namely <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> and <i>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask's</i> Stone of Agony. It would have been neat to have it neatly built-in, but hey ho!</p>
	<p>Another interesting observation about the controller is that the blue used on the "A" button is markedly darker than on OEM controllers. Looking at images online, I noted that both versions of the controller (N64-style and GC-style sticks) have the same coloured buttons, but in some images the buttons looked darker, like mine, whereas in others the colours looked the same as those of retail controllers.</p>
	<p>Could this be an issue of use and fading? I'm not convinced, because although this 25-year-old pad has probably been clutched by many a grubby hand, the controller condition is, in my opinion, exceptional. Could it be that there are variations in production quality? Again, I'm unsure that is the reason, because Nintendo would be extremely strict with their brand guidelines, and any deviation would probably have been picked up and the parts replaced.</p>
	<p>I'm a big fan of this non-canon variant of the N64 controller and now I just need to obtain the N64-stick version so that I can compare the two side-by-side.</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Ideal for Y2K hotel stays.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Robust-feeling GC-Style stick.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>lengthy cable for playing in comfort.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>No rumble function whatsoever.<br>

	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>The LodgeNet N64 controller is a great showpiece, and a symbol of a bygone era. Nowadays we have wifi and capable mobile phones to keep us occupied in hotels, but back then, Nintendo pushed the boundaries and adapted their hardware to afford gamers options around the world.</p>
