	<h4>Four's a (Good) Crowd</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>If you recall, back in July 2024, I reviewed the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r9">BlueRetro N64 adaptor</a>, a Bluetooth-enabled dongle that allows you to connect any Bluetooth controller to the Nintendo 64 via one of its controller sockets. Today I have the next evolution, the missing link between shoving one into each socket and something else entirely.</p>
	<p>The BlueRetro 4-way Adaptor does what it says on the tin; it allows four controllers to connect to it and slots into all four controller ports. But is it any good?</p>

	<h4>Multi-Tapped</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The idea behind this device is to simply connect four controllers to the BT dongle and connect the dongle itself to each of the four N64 controller sockets. This is done by the device having four controller plugs built in, and all you need to do is connect them, one into each port, in the order they are attached, from left to right. You might need to manipulate the short cables a little to get them aligned pleasingly after seating, but having four points of contact also dispels any potential power drain issues, and everyone can have rumble!</p>
	<p>Once connected and the power turned on, the device lights up. Holding the "boot" button initiates pairing mode, and on a PS5 DualSense controller, for example, you can hold the "Create" and "PS" buttons to put it into pairing mode too. You can connect any controller you like to this device; just be mindful of button mappings and awkward third-party pads. The BlueRetro software onboard is pre-configured for a variety of input devices, including PS3, PS4, PS5, Wii & Wii U, 8BitDo, Retro-Bit, Xbox One & Series controllers, Switch Pro controller, and even Joy-Cons (NS1).</p>
	<p>Each controller that is connected is assigned a port and gets an LED (1p = red/2p = green/3p = orange/4p = white) to signify its connection status. If you have issues pairing, you can simply tap "boot" to disconnect and reconnect everyone again. The "EN" button is used to cycle the dongle's own power. You only need to use that if you come entirely unstuck and encounter a major issue. Throughout my testing I didn't undergo anything terrible whatsoever.</p>

	<h4>It's Okay When it's a 4-Way</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Once connected and you're away, the experience is fantastic. Each player is able to have rumble, gyro, multiple triggers, you name it, as long as their pad supports it and the pad is supported by the dongle. I tested Wii U Pro controllers, Switch Pro controllers, Joy-Cons, PS4 and PS5 controllers and had an absolute blast out of the box, with no need to mess about or configure anything after connecting. The N64 NSO controller is one of the best to use for an authentic feel, and the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r69">8BitDo 64</a> is also very nice for a blend of N64 buttons with a modern feel.</p>
	<p>I never noticed any lag, ghosting or input issues when it came to button presses. Nor did I notice any interference between the 4 devices when connected and playing simultaneously. The only thing I would point out, is that each stick is different on new devices and doesn't quite align with the N64's gate, so games like <i>GoldenEye 007</i> could prove tricky to dial in those perfect snipes or when aiming quickly into the corners of the screen with the reticle, for example.</p>
	<p>The biggest downside to these devices is usually the update process, which, as I mentioned before in the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r9">BlueRetro N64 adaptor review</a>, sucks. The process is web-based, there is no dedicated app, and it takes forever *IF* you can get it to work. Thankfully, this came preconfigured and updated to the latest with a forked firmware based on <a href="https://github.com/darthcloud/BlueRetro">DarthCloud's original BlueRetro project</a> to facilitate 4-player connection and the relevant LED indicators. There was no updating necessary; it just works out of the box!</p>
	<p>I love the convenience of this device, but you need to remember to recharge your wireless controllers for use, an issue any stock N64 with 4 controllers never saw.</p>
