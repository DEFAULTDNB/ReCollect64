	<h4>Classic yet Modernised</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>After nine months of waiting, I finally have the latest interpretation of the Nintendo 64 controller in my hands, and I have to say that first impressions are phenomenal.</p>
	<p>8BitDo have seemingly taken everything that made their fantastic Ultimate Controller incredible and given it a 64-bit infusion by way of the face buttons, stick, and triggers.</p>
	<p>The analogue stick has a GameCube feel to it as opposed to the OG stick, and it is extremely smooth. The D-pad is ever so slightly smaller than that of an OG controller's, but it feels less rattly than the ones on my old controllers, far more solid, and works comfortably in-game.</p>
	<p>In comparison to the OEM controller, the stick and D-pad are somewhat swapped. The stick is now on the left of the controller, and the D-pad sits below the stick. While it sounds like it might be difficult to wrap your head around, it weirdly isn't.</p>

	<h4>Sleekly Styled</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>First things first, this Â£39.99 pad looks incredible, especially in matte black, though white is also an option. It has the "Ultra 64" black prototype button look to it that I really dig.</p>
	<p>The 64 Controller is slightly smaller than the OG controller. An N64 pad sizes up at 160 mm x 152.6 mm (width/height), whereas this measures just 147 mm x 104 mm. It's more compact and draws a lot of its sensibilities and refinements of its form factor from the Xbox One pad, as well as the stick/D-pad placement of the Nintendo Switch Pro controller.</p>
	<p>The layout and integration of the N64's face buttons is brilliant, and even the smaller shoulder buttons and additional Z triggers feel great. Picking this up and jumping into a game on an emulator has never felt so natural with a modern controller, and remapping is a breeze with button names that match that of the original system.</p>
	<p>The only thing missing is the central prong; however, the analogue stick being directly above the left handle, as well as a left-hand-side L button, gives your muscle memory a little jolt in the right direction, and it has to be said that it feels good. Overall the controller fits my meaty man hands just fine, and my thumbs rest perfectly on the buttons and stick with zero effort.</p>

	<h4>Fresh Features</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The controller features a drift-proof Hall Effect joystick and triggers, a wear-resistant metal joystick ring, turbo functions, vibration, an S/D switch (essentially Nintendo Switch mode or Direct-Input), and it weighs just 226 grams in total. Its rechargeable 1000 mAh battery takes around 2-3 hours and has a duration of approximately 36 hours, though I'm yet to find out exactly how long it lasts, as it's barely 24 hours old!</p>
	<p>You can use this controller wired (USB-C charge/data cable is supplied) or through Bluetooth, on an array of compatible platforms, and thanks to 8BitDo's Ultimate Software, you can remap buttons, adjust vibration levels, set up macros and profiles (that are stored on the controller), and even adjust the stick sensitivity.</p>
	<p>The stick itself has a familiar tactile and grippy pattern on the top, which keeps your thumbs from slipping, even when moistened by sweat. As well as the six N64 face buttons, which have an exacting and iconic camber and placement to the original, there are three more buttons across the top, star, select, and home, which can be used to invoke more functions, such as swapping the buttons by holding A + B + select to flip A and B, for example. You can also toggle the turbo modes by holding any button and tapping select once for turbo and twice for auto fire.</p> 
	<p>The star button is mainly used for screenshots when used on Nintendo Switch consoles, and the home button can be used to toggle vibration intensity or exit a game, but all buttons can be remapped in emulators to do whatever you want, so I have mine set up for screenshots, soft reset, and hard reset back to the ROM directory.

	<h4>Diagonal Disaster</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As noted by members on the Analogue 3D subreddit, and as confirmed in my tests, the ranges on the stick gate for the cardinal directions are around +-85 (84 in my test), which is ideal; however, and this is a big one, the diagonal directions only read up to +-60 (59 in my test), which indicates that the physical hardware itself, within the Hall Effect potentiometer switches, is not 1:1 with an OEM stick from an N64 controller (typically +-70), regardless of this claim currently on their site: "<b>Featuring the original gate</b> and signature concave rubber joystick cap."</p>
	<p>Another thing to note is that the gate itself only measures 18 mm diagonally, as opposed to 20 mm up/down/left/right, so unless a firmware update is released to increase the increments from 60 to 85 between the distances tilted by the stick, games played that require diagonal inputs might feel slightly off, and that's a lot of titles that employ precision aiming or character movement.</p>
	<p>Personally, as a fan of the system and a regular player of the games, I found that overall the controller feels great. Games like <i>Mario Kart 64 Amped Up V3.01</i> and <i>Smash Remix V2.0.0</i> steer and manoeuvre superbly, and precision aiming in games like <i>GoldenEye 007</i> and <i>Perfect Dark</i> felt reasonable to me. I would assume that speedrunners and experts might have a differing opinion on this, and I can't wait to hear their thoughts on this controller once they have it in their hands.</p>
	<p>I would say that games like <i>Star Fox 64</i> did feel a little sluggish on the diagonals, compared to using a real OEM stick, but hopefully firmware updates might be able to rectify the sensitivity to make it at least simulate an N64's diagonals, because 60/85 </p>

	<h4>Compatibility Clashes</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>While this controller is compatible with the upcoming Analogue 3D, as well as Windows, Nintendo Switch, and Android out of the box on version 1.00, you will need to update it to V1.02 to use it on a Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p>
	<p>When connecting to the updater software, it was not recognised and the product SKU had not been added to the database to manually update it. Luckily, some plucky users found the manual updater on 8BitDo's servers, and I used <a href="https://tempfiles.8bitdo.com/NS2/8BitDo64BL102.zip">this tool</a> to effortlessly update the firmware, making it work perfectly on my shiny new Nintendo Switch 2 console, for NSO N64 games at least.</p>
	<p>Using a BlueRetro device, I easily connected it by pressing the start button to turn it on and the sync button to pair it but found that the buttons were borked. After a considerable amount of trial and effort, attempting to remap the 3 buttons that wouldn't play ball, I finally discovered that <b>the controller needed to be switched into S-mode to fully function on the N64</b>. I had incorrectly assumed it needed to be in X or D-mode (Direct Input mode), and so unnecessarily struggled for far longer than anyone should have. Why I didn't test S-mode sooner will remain a mystery!</p>
	<p>On real hardware, this controller is excellent because there was zero noticeable input lag, and the stick felt extremely smooth in-game. I have to say that the responsiveness felt impeccable, the buttons all worked absolutely perfectly in every game, and the built-in rumble worked flawlessly too.</p>

	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>The gate diagonals are wrong.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>While it remains to be seen if this controller is any good on the Analogue 3D, the 8BitDo 64 Controller has already won its place in my arsenal of controllers to use for emulated gaming, as well as on original consoles.</p>
	<p>This is one of the most satisfying implementations of a modern N64 controller that I have had the pleasure of testing, albeit with one caveat, but unless something goes drastically wrong, I will definitely be using this as my daily driver!</p>
