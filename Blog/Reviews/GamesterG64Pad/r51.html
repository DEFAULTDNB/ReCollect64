	<h4>Familiar Features</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Gamester, Gamester, Gamester. When they imagined crafting peripherals for the Nintendo 64, I don't think anyone realised what a monster they would become. With controllers, wheels, rumble and memory paks, they really did swamp the third-party market with their blanket coverage, or "range", of things for people to purchase.</p>
	<p>Today, I have before me another Gamester controller, one that I had to do a little digging to find a name for, and unsurprisingly it came back as a member of the G64 series. The Gamester G64 Controller, or pad, is one of the closest-looking cousins of the OEM N64 controller, but it still manages to have that trademark gimpy Gamester look about it. Understandably, Nintendo had patented and owned the iconic trident shape, so Gamester seems to have attempted to get as close as possible without stepping on any legal toes.</p>
	<p>The G64, like many of the Gamester accessories, came in all the iconic colours, such as red, blue, green, yellow, black and fundamental-64 grey.</p>

	<h4>64 Shades of Grey</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The first, most glaring aspect of this controller is the directional pad on the left. It's flatter than a pancake and not very tactile. The small embossed arrows on it are so minimal that should you work up a sweat, you're going to slip off immediately. It's mushy too and probably only good for chucking fireballs in <i>Street Fighter 2</i>, a game that sadly never made it onto the N64 anyway.</p>
	<p>The next point of interest is the line of bubble-style buttons across the top. Slow, auto and turbo are emblazoned in a row of horridly large switches that offer the additional functionalities at a reasonable reaching distance when the controller is held. I'm sure I have mentioned this in prior reviews, but I don't understand the concept of a slow-motion toggle. I can't conceive enjoying a game that is constantly being paused and unpaused repeatedly, and barring painfully slowly cheating your way through a bullet-hell style shoot 'em up game like <i>Dezaemon 3D</i>, I can't envisage using it for anything else. Please let me know if there is another good use case for this; perhaps I cannot see the wood for the trees?</p>
	<p>The shoulder buttons are present. That's about the nicest thing I can say about them. They sit there clunky and angular, with no respect paid to the curves and design language of the console from whence it technically came. They work, and they're present, but they're nothing to write home about.</p>

	<h4>Not Grey-t</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The main face buttons on the G64 are the best part of this controller. They have a nice raised profile, not too high, not too dissimilar to the OEM controller, but the Start button feels a little too deeply embedded to be pressed ergonomically.</p>
	<p>The stick on this is pretty bad, but not <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r50">the worst I have seen on a Gamester controller</a>. The gate is almost square except for the divots in the top and bottom right corners, which makes any delicate touches in any type of game extremely inaccurate.</p>
	<p>I have to say that whatever QC "testing" these controllers went through, it wasn't enough. It's almost criminal that these were released as an alternative and worse that parents actually paid hard-earned money for these. Barring the exceptional <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r19">Evolution Controller</a>, no Gamester product, wheel or controller has yet scored more than a middle-of-the-road 5/10 in the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#HallOfFame">Recollect64 "Hall of Fame" review round-up page</a>. At this point I feel like we should unanimously rename "Gamester" to "Cash-Grabster".</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Not the worst controller from Gamester.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Another horrible feeling stick.</br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>The D-pad is pretty naff.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>Some might ask, "Is it that bad?" Well, it is and it isn't. If you're a casual gamer, the kind that always assumes the player two role, then you probably wouldn't notice the inaccuracies of this pad. But do not consider this as a potential replacement for the OEM, even in a bind. It is far too low quality for recommendation as a reliable controller.</p>
