	<h4>Fidget Friends</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Back in March, I obtained one half of the coolest keychains in town, the N64 gashapon collection. In July, it will have been a full year since they released them and I can finally report that after 11 months, I finally have both pieces of the 64-bit puzzle!</p>
	<p>The button variant is the perfect accomplice to the stick, especially when both are held at the same time. They complement each other and holding them gives you the feeling of living in a dystopian future where the N64 controller was (finally) recognised as the best thing ever, and you now have split-pad wireless controllers in your hands. Frissons, frissons eveywhere.</p>
	<p>Clicking the buttons, they feel remarkably similar to your controllers. When put next to an OEM controller, the alignment is identical, the colours are the same, the amount of travel to depress the buttons and the tactile feeling running your fingertips across them is exactly as you would expect. It's spot on.</p>

	<h4>Rattly Rings</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As with the other keyring, it's still a little clunky, but less so for its lower profile and inability to hook on something in your pocket. This one is more compact and more pocketable than the other one, but I personally enjoy the freedom of a 360-degree analogue stick to the base I/O nature of a button.</p>
	<p>My only complaint with this one is the shaky noise it makes when, well, shaken. It sounds a little loose in there, like they should have packed it out with a little more rubber to prevent such a noise, but perhaps it would have impacted the feel. It's a minor grumble, but a valid one, because it might get worse or loosen further over time with use.</p>
	<p>I'm a huge fan of these, and in all honesty, if they brought these to European shores, I'm sure they would sell just as well as they do in Japan, albeit without Japanese scalpers able to sell them at inflated prices to UK N64 fans, such as myself.</p>

	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>While I prefer the stick to the buttons, they make a great set. My main quibbles still apply: why can't we get cool things like these easily in the rest of the world?!</p>
