	<h4>Pro or Amateur?</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Manufacturers often use terms such as "Pro", "Professional", or "Turbo" to enhance the image of their controllers. Nine times out of ten, this strategy affords them a few additional sales, but more often than not it actually equates to next to no beneficial features over an OEM controller.</p>
	<p>InterAct made a lot of peripherals for the Nintendo 64, too many, some might say, and most of them failed to crack the top 20th percentile when it came to honest reviews. Sure, they look outrageously fun and have a certain air of mystique to some of them, but in all honesty, it's a facade, hiding the fact that they are middle-of-the-range at best.</p>
	<p>The Shark Pad Pro 2 proceeded the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Nintendo-64-InterAct-SharkPad-Pro.jpg/1104px-Nintendo-64-InterAct-SharkPad-Pro.jpg">Shark Pad Pro</a> and attempted to deviate from the almost OEM trident look by removing any trace of it at all. The result is a controller that feels rotten to hold, with an overpoweringly plastic feel, with poor trigger/shoulders and slippery buttons.</p>

	<h4>Sticky Stiffy</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The Shark Pad Pro 2 has a nice tight snappy stick that appears decent on the surface. The gate and range of movement are not terrible either. The top, left and bottom results are respectably within the threshold of an OEM stick; however, the right-hand side shows an extended area of range. At almost +10 more than the left side, it's a definite discrepancy, though honestly, it doesn't feel that far off in-game. I have to admit that sniping, racing, and platforming feel decent with this stick, albeit a bit stiff. Had it been a little easier to manoeuvre and taken a little less effort to push around, it would have been a far smoother experience.</p>

	<p>While the buttons are all technically in the right place and the trigger and bumpers are present, the face buttons are convex, as opposed to flat, which makes it easy to slip off and quickly creates indents in your fingertips. Shoulder button ergonomics are also heinous, jutting out from an unnatural 45-degree angle in comparison to an OEM controller's almost right-angled normality. The trigger doesn't give "trigger" energy at all. It feels too small and too rectangular. Granted, the trigger on any N64 controller is not analogue, nor is it particularly trigger-shaped; however, this one is particularly flat and bland.</p>
	<p>In-game, the controller's buttons, D-pad and stick do perform well, but the shape of the pad is jarring. It feels like an OEM controller has had both prongs amputated, and then the whole thing has been stung by bees. The form factor is too bloated to be comfortable for long periods, and its overall thickness makes it unpleasant to hold on to.</p>
	<p>I am a fan of the transparent look, and it also features Auto and Slow buttons, but those ingredients are far from enough to save this controller from tumbling into the void with all the other misshapen third-party pads of yore.</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Nice feeling stick (but a little stiff).<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Slow-mo and auto-fire features.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Convex face buttons.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Horrid trigger & bumpers.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Displeasing shape and feel.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>Though not the worst stick on a third-party pad, InterAct manages to alienate players with yet another bizarre form factor that will never be a seriously viable stand-in for an OEM controller.</p>
