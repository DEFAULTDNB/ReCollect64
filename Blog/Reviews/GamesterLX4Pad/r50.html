	<h4>Blue-ming Hell!</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>It's not often I find a piece of retro that I vividly recall, but never actually owned or used. The Gamester LX4 series controller is one of these things that I remember seeing in my local Dixons back in the late 90s and thinking, "Wow that's a weird-ass controller!"</p>
	<p>When it comes to form factor, Gamester's LX4 controller flagrantly disregards any style, shape and comfortability that Nintendo purposefully designed into their OEM controller. The LX4 hacks off the prongs, shuns curves, and brings you one of the absolute worst feeling controllers I have ever had the misfortune of purchasing.</p>
	<p>I recently grabbed this for just £9, and it came bundled with four Memory Paks, including two OG blue ones that it would have been sold for. The original RRP was roughly £45, which is unbelievable given that the OEM controller retailed for just £40 at release and around £20 or less by 1999.</p>

	<h4>The Blue it!</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As you can see, the controller is an abomination. It's horrible to look at and even worse to have to hold onto. In the most inexplicable move, they have audaciously left the Z-trigger in the typical position but removed the central handle altogether. The result is the feeling of holding onto a doorknob while twiddling the stick and trying to pull the trigger without slipping off. Gamester really dropped the ball with this design, but guess what, it's absurdly not just the shape that's terrible.</p>
	<p>Every button on this pad feels off. The shoulders are too far in, the C-buttons are too small and stand too proud, and while the start button is arguably the best design choice seen here, the additional slow/auto/turbo buttons are far too small to be located easily in the heat of gameplay. The worst feature by far is the stick. It's too loose-feeling and offers no resistance. It "works", sure, but it "works" so badly it's debatable if this thing was ever thoroughly tested prior to release. How they ever had the gall to price this thing at £44.99 is beyond my rationalisation.</p>

	<h4>Feeling Blue</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As you might have gathered, this controller is possibly the worst. Having put it through several rounds of gameplay, I simply could not recommend this controller to anyone for any genre of game out there. It is equally abysmal for all types of games and especially bad for aiming or anything precision-based in any other game.</p>
	<p>The stick test visualises my absolute hatred for this thing. The octagonal gate is so far off the norm it is embarrassing, with the live stick test revealing the full extent of the truly malformed circumference. I think you get the idea, and I don't wish to waste any more energy, or your time, on this review than we need to. On to the scores!</p>

	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>I didn't think it was possible to beat the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r17">Logic3 6T4 pad</a> in terms of terribleness, but here we have our winner.</p>
	<p>If you ever had to use one of these as a younger sibling or a "player two", I can wholeheartedly sympathise with your current therapy bills.</p>
	<p>Avoid at all costs, even if it's possible to obtain cheaply today.</p>
