	<h4>Buy These Wonderous Things!</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>In an effort to expand ReCollect64, I'm starting something new which may help enable me to fund future purchases of bigger and better items for review!</p>
	<p>As a collector of games, merchandise, and memorabilia, I wanted to put out something simple yet nostalgic, resourceful, and aesthetically pleasing, so with that I am proud to present my N64 Game Frames!</p>
	<p>The driving ethos behind these products is to only use destroyed magazines in order to preserve and display their information and to part with any doubles or carts with "character". Everything presented here is legitimate, official cartridges and clippings, presented in a stylish way to allow you to gift them to yourself or your loved ones.</p>
	<p>I have already sold a couple on other marketplaces, and no two items will ever be identical because of the way they are sourced and combined.</p>
	<p>Please have a browse and <a href="mailto:recollect64official@gmail.com" target="_blank">feel free to contact me at any time if you have any enquiries or any ideas on custom commissions</a>.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Items are subject to availability. No two will ever be identical so it's strictly first come, first served.

			<li>Feel free to ask me for further pictures of the items if you are unsure of the condition of the cartridges.
			<li>Please enquire about custom commissions through my contact email if you have an idea for a frame that you would like made.
			<li>Shipping will be calculated individually depending on your country of residence, and includes packaging costs and tracking.
			<li>You can pay extra for shipping insurance if you would like to, but please make that clear at the time of sale.
			<li>Please allow adequate time for shipping, especially taking into account public holidays and weekends.
			<li>Payment can be made by PayPal or bank transfer. I will contact you with the relevant information at the time of sale.
