		<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> 10/12/2025 - The theme has been announced as "Repair", and the charity pot total sits at a wholesome $1357.69 at the time of writing:</p>
	<div class="container">
	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>It’s been a big year for Right To Repair thanks to many legislative pushes worldwide. And with the release of the A3D, what was once a dwindling stock of console has now been given a new rebirth. This word has also been on my mind these past few months, so I thought it would be appropriate.</p>
