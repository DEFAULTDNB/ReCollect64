	<h4>Console Collective</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Since <a href="https://x.com/AzumFpg">Robert Peip</a>'s N64 core became an absolute must-have for FPGA users <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b47">last year</a>, the ability to play the 64-bit console on hardware, as opposed to emulated, has been a game changer. Now, a UK-based company called Heber is producing a consolised version of the FPGA hardware that accommodates multiple systems into one svelte package.</p>
	<p>The Multisystem² is able to clone a variety of consoles with low-latency, cycle-accurate performance thanks to its on-board Altera Cyclone 5 FPGA chipset with 128MB SDRAM and 1GB of LPDDR RAM. The project aims to be a complete all-in-one solution for players to enjoy, with no additional hardware or tinkering required, and taps into the MiSTer FPGA project, which is a community-driven resource that has plenty of <a href="https://mister-devel.github.io/MkDocs_MiSTer/cores/console/">console cores</a> to choose from, including NES, SNES, <b>N64</b>, NeoGeo, PSX and a plethora of arcade boards.</p>
	<p>The console is available in two forms, analogue and digital, both of which feature a silent operation fanless console (fully assembled) in a charcoal black 3D printed enclosure, full compatibility with standard MiSTer cores, 7 USB ports, HDMI out, an integrated ppower switch with power/voltage/overload protection and full compatible with Zaparoo NFC discs, stickers and cards.</p>
	<p>The analogue version boasts additional 24-bit analogue video output (can be set to 18-bit with onboard dip switches), 9 pin mini-DIN RGB output, audio & C-Sync for SCART (using Genesis 2/Megadrive 2 SCART Cable), VGA 15 way port for analogue video output, ethernet port for direct internet connection, Audio output via 3.5mm jack, digital audio output via TOSlink, expansion cartridge slot for modular upgrades and enhancements and many dedicated cartridge modules available such as S-video, MT32Pi and original system controller interfaces for SNES, NES, PlayStation, Saturn, N64, PCEngine, and features a "future 50 way expansion" for dedicated hardware upgrades and interfacing.</p>

	<p>The Multisystem² is a next-generation, all-in-one consolised retro gaming machine which uses cutting-edge FPGA hardware emulation for the most accurate gaming experience compared with playing on original hardware.</p>
	<p>The Multisystem² features a brand new system board design with multiple connectivity built-in, and a plethora of expansion options which can take advantage of current Multisystem add-ons and future expansions not possible until now, thanks to the Multisystem²’s direct access to the FPGA hardware.</p>
	<p>All Multisystem² consoles come fully assembled and ready-to-play in a custom-designed, high quality 3D printed case.</p>

	<h4>Tasty Little SNAC</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The analogue version of the console features an expansion port, not dissimilarly placed to the N64 one, that can have <a href="https://misterfpga.co.uk/product-category/mister-snac/">SNAC expansion boards</a> plugged into it to allow authentic retro controllers and peripherals to be connected. As seen in the images above, the N64 SNAC accessory features four controller sockets for multiplayer which will allow you to use your favourite OG controllers on the console. It is not known whether rumble paks work on the device when plugged in, as even on the N64 hardware, power drain was an issue if you had more than two rumble paks attached at any one time.</p>
	<p>The Multisystem² is set to ship for £252 (£210 excluding VAT) in August 2025 following pre-orders that begin today (May 6th at 2:00pm UK time), with Heber stating that they are already manufacturing units in preparation for this release window. How will it compete with the £250 <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b37">Analogue 3D</a>, or the $160 MiSTer Pi? Regardless, it's heart-warming to see more ways the N64 can become accessible to the gamers as it approaches its 30th anniversary in 2026, so let's hope for as few delays as possible in order to celebrate this momentous occasion!</p>
	<p>While the console only comes in an N64-like charcoal black, Heber are freely releasing the 3D print files so that you can produce any colour variant you wish in the comfort of your own home, so we might see funtastic colours, modifications and possibly refinements from the community soon.</p>
	<p>Another note is that this console will not feature dual RAM because this is primarily intended for end-users and not developers. Consumers will also have to provide their own SD card, power supply and ROMs (for copyright reasons), so this will not come with any games whatsoever, nor will it be "fully loaded" when shipped directly from Heber.</p>
