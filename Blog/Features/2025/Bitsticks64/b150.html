	<h4>Modernised Modules</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When it comes to prolonging the life of OG N64 accessories and consoles, I love to see it. This week, <a href="https://x.com/The8bitbeast">The8bitbeast</a> and <a href="https://x.com/StingySeagull">StingySeagull</a> announced the grand opening of their 64-bit controller-refreshing store, <a href="https://bitsticks64.com/">bitsticks64.com</a>.</p>
	<p>Having reached out to The8bitbeast for further details on their products and ideology, I was informed that StingySeagull is the technical and materials specialist and The8bitbeast works on fine-tuning ready for speedrunning and beta testing. After 10 months of prototyping, they have settled on hardened steel to line the bowls, combined with steel or plastic sticks; the latter is a choice based on personal preference, as they perform very similarly according to stick test variance results.</p>
	<div class="container">
	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>Steel sticks have a screw on top thumb stick and a little nib plastic bit that sits right in the bottom where it contacts the bowl. We ship them with two of those little nibs in case they need replacing and might look at doing different nib sizes in the future so that people can customise the amount of resistance they get.</p>

	<p>The current modules or prebuilt controllers on the site range from £69 to £94, depending on if you want to purchase a drop-in module or a fully refurbished and modified controller which has been fully cleaned and given new button pads. With the prebuilt controllers, you get the option of either "good" or "medium" condition with the choice of sticks, making four combinations to select from.</p>
	<p>The option to have a full controller is priced reasonably in comparison to purchasing just a module so that the price gap is minimal and the barrier to entry is ideal for potential customers to enjoy the product straight out of the box. Having utilised the components from these controllers to manufacture the enhanced modules, it makes perfect sense to repurpose the shells and provide an additional pre-built package. Less waste, less fuss!</p>
	<h4>Product Preparation</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With many other products on the market currently striving to offer similar quality, the pair have an ace up their sleeve to get ahead of competitors and give customers a better chance at obtaining a sleek, new, high-performance module:</p>

	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>The big difference with this project vs others is that we have a manufacturer who can produce these in bulk. We've got about 30 left ready to go for these initial sales. Then we can have more in a matter of weeks.</p>
	<p>This should hopefully solve some of the scalability issues and huge waiting lists that are often common in the metal stick/bowl scene.</p>

	<p>Having seen the benchmark results, which are exceptionally close to the stock 80-85 OEM range (80-86 for BitSticks64), the sticks offer a more budget-friendly alternative to their closest competitors. It must be stated that each product out there has its own unique selling points, strengths and weaknesses, so it's worth considering what exactly you wish to get out of purchasing a replacement stick module before you buy one.</p>
	<p>Regardless, with clear plans for scalable production in mind, it's certainly worth checking out BitSticks64 products because of how easy they are to obtain and install, or even just pick up and play, with absolutely zero hassle. Please check out the links below!</p>
