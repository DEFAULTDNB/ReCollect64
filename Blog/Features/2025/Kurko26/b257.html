	<p>Markus Kuro has been extremely productive throughout 2025 with releases such as the incredible <i><a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r54">BK: Nostalgia 64</a></i>, which released in May, and most recently <i><a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r84">BK: The Lair Witch Project</a></i>, which jump-scared us all to death for Halloween.</p>
	<p>That said, the ROM hacker is far from finished with his bountiful ideas spilling into 2026 with <i>BK4: Quest for Kurkoins</i> resuming production, price increases to his Patreon pricing and a whole lot more besides!</p>

	<p>Hi everyone!</p>
	<p>Firstly, I want to thank all the new followers who have joined this year, as well as those who have been supporting me for longer. Without your support, none of this would be possible. THANK YOU!</p>
	<p>I hope you enjoyed my two released projects this year: BK Nostalgia 64, released in May, and BK The Lair Witch Project, released on Halloween. Judging by the messages I've received, it seems you have! As for my next project, BK4: Quest for Kurkoins, I resumed development after releasing BK Nostalgia 64, but for various reasons, I haven't been able to dedicate as much time to it as I would have liked. BK The Lair Witch Project took up 100% of my time in September, October, and part of November, and then I was focused on restoring new artwork and preparing new wallpapers and videos for November and December, so I haven't had much free time. </p>
	<p>On another note, I want to announce that I'm also working on a small collaboration for a Zelda mod that I'm really excited about. I can't give any more details right now... but here is a PIC<i>(See below)</i>! I hope you'll like it when it's released. I'm also helping with the testing for a "special" version of BK Nostalgia 64 I can't talk about yet... small clip <a href="https://mega.nz/file/VoFWHKyK#D92E1g7iF3pcsU5Ak_LhK8faAn_k__Mv5iE9LijygeU">HERE!</a> Looks great, huh? 👀</p>
	<p>So, what's new for 2026? Let's get to it!</p>
	<p>1 - Resuming development of BK4: Quest for Kurkoins. In a couple of months at the latest, I should have much more free time to dedicate to this project. And from then on, I'll focus on it 100% until its release.</p>
	<p>2 - More "special" versions of my mods? Who knows... 👀</p>
	<p>3 - The following is some minor bad news, but I feel I need to be clear about it and announce it: I'm going to have to raise Patreon prices slightly (however, those of you who are already SUBSCRIBED or subscribe BEFORE 2026 will continue to pay the CURRENT PRICE!). I've tried to postpone this as long as possible, but after 5 years with the same prices, a small adjustment is necessary.</p>
	<p>The new prices starting in January will be as follows:</p>
	<p>- Musical Note: €1.99 -> €2.99</p>
	<p>- Mumbo Token: €4.99 -> €5.99</p>
	<p>- Golden Jiggy: €9.99 -> €11.99</p>
	<p>- Ice Key: €19.99 (Coming 2026) TBD</p>
	<p>4 - Yes, you read that right, I have ideas for a new tier called ICE KEY. However, I haven't had time to concrete what benefits it might offer, so there will be more info in the future.</p>

	<p>The above image gives us a delightful little tease as to the direction of the <i>Zelda x BK</i> collaboration. Having dungeons to explore with puzzle-based secrets to unlock would be a fantastic setting for the duo to bound around. No doubt there will be a lot of Easter eggs to discover too!</p>
	<p>Lots to look forward to there, but you can influence the flow by sharing your opinions via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/poll-what-do-you-146205212">polls on his Patreon page</a>. So I highly encourage you to get voting and support him with his next batch of wondrous ROM hacks!</p>
