	<p>Recently, I came across a video that piqued my interest, and I wanted to share it with my loyal ReCollect 64 followers!</p>
	<p>You may well have seen this before; that's because it's a year old, but SpittleFPV has recently reposted it, in all its glory, just this week. Check it out in full below:</p>

	<p>Not only is the footage sublimely well framed, using a fantastic miniature to full effect (is that the figurine from Starlink: Battle for Atlas?), but the aftereffects and character chatter evoke a massive blast of nostalgia whilst watching.</p>
	<p>Nevertheless, that perfectly executed barrel roll at the end is the cherry on a jaw-dropping cake--a smooth-as-silk aileron roll that is so synchronistic with the series.</p>
	<p>I must have watched this about fifty times now, and each time I wonder how I would ever get any work done if I owned a drone and a mini Arwing!</p>
