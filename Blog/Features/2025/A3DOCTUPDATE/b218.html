	<h4>Assured Shipping</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With just 77 days remaining in 2025, Alaogue have dropped a nice little update on their social sites, that affirms preorder customers hopes that the product will ship sooner rather than later.</p>
	<p>Having already suffered several set backs, the company is doubling down on their latest promise, and giving people a glimmer of hope that no more delays are to be expected.</p>

	<h4>Previous Promises</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With preorder customers, such as myself, anticipating an email one week prior to shipping, it is nearly time to lock in and get hands on with the console after exactly <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b37">one year to the day that it was first announced</a>.</p>
	<p>I personally cannot wait to see the thing in real life and check out its features and benefits. Having never experienced FPGA gaming, this is will be a first for me, so I am very much looking forward to putting it through its paces whenever it may eventually arrive on my doorstep.</p>
	<p>Let us hope that there will no more delays, and no issues with the units from here on out, as potential customers have already been put off by delays and lack of communication from the company over the last 365 days. Analalogue has yet to post a single N64 hype gif, despite the console purportedly releasing in the near future.</p>
