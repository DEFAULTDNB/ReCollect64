	<p>Link has been the around since 1986. Across various reincarnations, he has appeared in almost 30 games to date and stands as an endearing symbol of power, courage, and wisdom regardless of his ever-changing looks.</p>
	<p>On the NES and SNES, Link's 2D form was well established, but the transition into 3D on the Nintendo 64 prompted a more realistic and characterful evolution of the silent protagonist, with visions of him as both an adult and a child. Only appearing in three N64 games, let's dive into the models we did get of the Hero of Time!</p>

	<p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</i> and <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> use identical models for Link as an adult because Nintendo tasked their team, headed by Eiji Aonuma and Yoshiaki Koizumi, to hastily produce a second game by recycling the assets of the first. That being said, the aesthetic used on Link in child form during OOT's development was said to be styled on famous faces such as River Phoenix and Leonardo DiCaprio, hence the foppish hairstyle and boyish looks.</p>
	<p>The model uses 735 tris and 2205 vertices, slightly less than <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b88">Mario's</a> model did and slightly more than <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b119">DK's</a> in their starring games.</p>
	<p>As a bonus, here is the Fierce Deity model from Majora's Mask. Though it is essentially a reskin, it does a fantastic job of souping up the design and making it feel like an entirely new character you're taking control of. I really love the design and the mythology that has gone into this mask, with it belonging to a mysterious and powerful spirit who directly rivals Majora.</p>

	<p>With both mainline Zelda titles on the N64 hailing from the triumphant hero/child timeline, it makes sense that they are markedly similar in artistic style. Child Link from MM uses 736 tris and 2208 vertices to achieve this well-articulated animated model, whereas the OOT child Link model uses 696 with 2088 vertices to almost the same effect. The main alterations come from the remodelling of his face, head and sideburns, and the addition of a sash. Link looks more mature in <i>Majora's Mask</i>, and even the colouring adds to the darker, more mysterious tone of the game.</p>
	<p>As a fan of both games and the triangle count difference being negligible, my personal favourite remains that of OOT because I was there when it released, and this was the first fully 3D Link I had ever witnessed. The paradigm shift between SNES and N64 was all-encompassing, and having played games throughout that era, it really hammers home the phenomenon that was OOT looking back on these models today.</p>

	<p>I usually sound off about how janky the models are in <i>Super Smash Bros.</i>, but today I'm changing my tone because this model actually looks half decent... except for that razor-sharp Pinocchio-looking nose!</p>
	<p>Using 610 triangles and just 638 vertices for everything, this is a rather successful mesh simplification, managing to capture enough from the 1997 model as well as getting it running smoothly in the 1999 beat 'em up.</p>

	<p>Prior to the public unveiling of the Nintendo 64, the Super Nintendo was the main machine. Using the Super FX chip, games started to transition from 2D to 3D, with games such as <i>Vortex, Stunt Race FX</i> and <i>Starwing</i> using simple wireframe models to power their environments and models.</p>
	<p>Thanks to the 2020 Gigaleak, the above model was found within <i>Starwing</i>'s data and suggests that Nintendo were toying with a 3D version of Link back in 1993. There is a possibility that the model would be used for a 3D remake of <i>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</i>, though there is very little evidence to suggest this is the exact reason. Following <i>Starwing</i>'s success, the team at Argonaut moved on to the fully 3D <i>Star Fox 64/Lylat Wars</i>, which would release in 1997, along with the Rumble Pak, on the N64.</p>
	<p>This departure from the Super FX chip meant that the idea of a 3D Link would be put on the back burner.</p>

	<p>In 1995, Zelda 64, as the working title was known, was being devised and refined by Shigeru Miyamoto on the Ultra 64 hardware. Back then, Link had not been publicly seen in 3D, so his first-ever appearance at the Spaceworld (Shoshinkai) exhibition of 1995 was a fascinating insight into the progression of the swordsman's jump from two dimensions to three, without ever knowing of the Super FX-powered model above.<p>
	<p>As you can see from the example, Link was bereft of his blond hair and tall stature in favour of something altogether different. The chibi design was said to be loosely based on the 2D SNES sprites, and I believe possibly even formed with the 1989 cartoon version of Link in mind.</p>

	</center>
	<p>It wouldn't be until Shoshinkai 1996 that Link got his recognisable blonde styling, and then in 1997 that the look was completed and released as we know it today. Below you can see the difference between 1995's and 1996's Link, who notably has a different face and darker hair than that of the final games' model. 1996's Link also has the 1995-style tunic with no shoulder detail, just brown arms and a green-dressed torso and waist.</p>
