	<h4>Weird Science</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With us entering into July, we are now officially in Analogue 3D release month territory, or are we?</p>
	<p>On Monday, I received an email from Amazon regarding my preorder for the 8BitDo 64 controller, stating that the preorder I made had been cancelled. Within this message was another link to an alternative listing for the same device, with perceivably identical text and descriptions, with a date of August 1st on. I preordered immediately to ensure I have a controller for the console that we all hope is coming out at some point this month, though with a date of August the 1st on the pad, is this indicative of another console delay?</p>

	<p>I have <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b80">previously reported</a> that the controller had been delayed from October 2024 to March 2025, and again to April 2025, and the console itself was also delayed until July this year, though no firm date, new information, or even video evidence of the console has been demonstrated. All we have are some <a href="https://www.analogue.co/3d">stills of 3DOS running on the console</a>, as well as a lot of marketing renders, a list of technical specs, and some spiel regarding 100% compatibility with cartridges. You would have thought that the hype train would be in full swing by now if a release were imminent within the next 28 days.</p>
	<p>Yesterday, Reddit user Gruby_Grubowski posted that they had in fact received their Analogue 3D-compatible controller early, with an accompanying image and a quick disclaimer that it had been purchased from a local Amazon seller and that they had simply honoured the sale by sending the item when they had inventory of it. Since then the seller has marked the item as unavailable and is no longer sending out units.</p>

	<p>According to the lucky receiver, the controller pairs to the Nintendo Switch (Lite) effortlessly, with ZL working as the Z-Trigger and ZR working for the suspend menu, and on PC it is recognised as an "8BitDo N80" and needed to be remapped to work with an N64 emulator. I am looking forward to trying this with a Bluetooth adaptor for my real N64 hardware to see how it works on an OG console as well as on PC, Switch, and the Analogue 3D console.</p>
	<p>What's interesting is that 8BitDo (who's chief tech officer is purportedly the chief executive officer of Analogue) don't seem to have a clue about potential release dates either, and clearly the stock of controllers is out there and ready to go when allowed to. Analogue themselves have kept completely schtumm regarding anything to do with the Analogue 3D console, posting nothing relevant since their previous bombshell that it would be delayed from October 2024 to July 2025.</p>
