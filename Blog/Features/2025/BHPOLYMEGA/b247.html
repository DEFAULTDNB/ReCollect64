	<h4>Shock and Awe</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Something that wasn't on my bingo card for 2025 was the re-release of DMA Design and Gremlin Interactive's 1998 action-adventure <i>Body Harvest</i>. No, your eyes are not deceiving you!</p>
	<p>The oddly priced £30.73 <i>Polymega Collection Volume 15</i> contains not one but two Nintendo 64 games, plus two PSOne games, pressed to compact disc. <i>Body Harvest</i> is joined by Vivid Image and Ubisoft's <i>S.C.A.R.S.</i>, along with <i>Burning Road</i> and <i>Dead in the Water</i> PlayStation One titles.</p>
	<div class="container">
	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i>
	<p>Rediscover a bold era of experimentation with this Polymega Collection, headlined by Body Harvest—the ambitious N64 action-adventure from the studio that would eventually perfect open world game design with legendary GTA franchise. Long celebrated for its ahead-of-its-time blend of open-world exploration, vehicle-hopping chaos, and sprawling sci-fi storytelling, Body Harvest stands here as a fascinating milestone in the evolution of modern game design.</p>
	<p>Complementing the main attraction is a curated selection of 32-bit gems that showcase the energetic, anything-goes creativity of the era, including the futuristic combat racer S.C.A.R.S., the high seas vehicular combat game Dead in the Water, and the high-speed racing game Burning Road. Together, they form a compact but evocative snapshot of late-’90s gaming—colorful, experimental, and refreshingly unpolished in all the right ways.</p>

	<h4>Power to the Piko</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>It's interesting to note that Piko Interactive is credited with <i>Body Harvest's</i> re-release. Piko Interactive, as recently as January 2018, acquired the intellectual property for <i>Body Harvest</i>, <i>S.C.A.R.S.</i>, and around 98 more IPs as part of a larger purchase of assets from the defunct publishers such as Infogrames, GT Interactive, and Gremlin Interactive.</p>
	<p>Though I'm disappointed that Polymega didn't go to the effort of making cartridges for use with their <a href="https://polymega.com/products/em05-ultra-module-set">EM05 Ultra Module Set</a>, it makes sense from a storage and distribution point of view and remains interesting nonetheless, and it will be fascinating to see what other N64 games surface via Piko Interactive on either the Polymega or on other platforms in the future.</p>
