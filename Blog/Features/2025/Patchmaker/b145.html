	<h4>Got it Sewn Up</h4>

	<p>Today, ROM hacker and modder <a href="https://x.com/CowQuackYT">CowQuack</a> has released the much-anticipated Tim Burton-esque <i>Super Mario 64</i> ROM hack, <i>The Patchmaker's Workshop</i>.</p>
	<p>The hack brings years worth of modding work into one marvellously creepy creation that sees Mario team up with a new partner across several brand new worlds in a bid to thwart "the crazed creator of all that surrounds", the Patchmaker.</p>

	<p>"One day, whilst crafting a plush doll, something miraculous occured. The doll smiled at me."</p>
	<p>Mario awakes inside a charming workshop with a dark past, with Peach and Bowser transformed into plush dolls sitting beside him.</p>
	<p>They had all been attacked by a man named The Patchmaker... To save them, he needs to team up with a creation of that man, the living doll Sewnia.</p>
	<p>Embark across 12 different worlds, collecting a new ability in each that helps Mario traverse that area.</p>
	<p>What secrets does this workshop hold? What goals does The Patchmaker have?</p>
	<p>...And how did Sewnia come to life exactly?</p>
	<p>The Patchmaker's Workshop features a fully original soundtrack composed by ornevelder, Tori Draws Stuff, and CowQuack.</p>

	<h4>Patch-tastic</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The mod transforms the standard 8 MB ROM into a 50 MB monster, brimming with custom levels, music, characters, and an epic story and dialogue exclusive to this creation.</p>
	<p>Mario has a multitude of interesting abilities, and even the HUD is given a makeover, with the power bar displayed in the top left corner as beads and a D-Pad at the bottom left with your abilities assigned to the various directions.</p>
	<p>To play the ROM hack, all you need to do is patch the USA <i>Super Mario 64</i> *.Z64 ROM (MD5: 20b854b239203baf6c961b850a4a51a2) with the BPS provided in the link below. The patched ROM will have an MD5 of 1ED9253297BA537B0C3F86824C59405B and is fully playable on consoles via flashcart or through emulators such as <a href="https://github.com/Rosalie241/RMG/releases">Rosalie's Mupen GUI</a> or <a href="https://ares-emu.net/">Ares</a>.</p>
