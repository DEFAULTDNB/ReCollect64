	<h4>Starlight, Star Bright</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>Surge of Starlight</i> is the latest in a string of modifications and hacks for <i>Super Mario 64</i> as it celebrates its 29th birthday in Japan.</p>
	<p>BusterDoggy2, <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i> speedrunner and content creator on YouTube and Twitter, gave himself the goal of crafting his very own ROM hack within the space of a year. The result is <i>SM64: Surge of Starlight</i>, a ROM hack that has 131 stars to collect and more than 20 custom levels!</p>
	<p>As an "easy kaizo" rated hack, meaning higher difficulty and requiring intricate manoeuvres, <i>Surge of Starlight</i> isn't for the faint of heart, but it's a great starting point for those who want to get into slightly more taxing hacks to complete. BusterDoggy himself stated that using save-states is probably the way to play because it turned out a tad bit harder than he intended it to be.</p>

	<p>For over a decade now... I have been obsessed with SM64 ROM hacks and always enjoyed playing them. Way back then, young me would constantly dream of making my own hack one day. I thought it would never happen though, because I had absolutely no programming and modelling knowledge at the time.</p>
	<p>Until last July that is... where I decided that no matter what, I'd learn whatever it took to create a fully custom, full game SM64 hack.</p>
	<p>Well, 11 months later... I am excited to say that I have completely finished the hack and am now ready to release it!</p>
	<p>My goal with this hack was to use as many of the modern tools and design techniques as possible, but while also kind of keeping an "old-school" feeling.</p>
	<p>This hack has 131 stars to collect, with 20+ custom level models. I hope you decide to try it out and enjoy playing it. Thank you and good luck! :)</p>
	<p>Apologizes for the lag in the trailer... my laptop can barely handle recording and running the ROM at the same time. I promise the hack won't be that choppy!</p>

	<h4>Tough Running</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Unfortunately, I could not get this hack to run on any of my flashcarts, so for now you'll have to use emulation if you wish to give it a try, which is probably for the best given the toughness and the inability to resort to save states.</p>
	<p>Patching the ROM is simple; just take the 8 MB USA <i>Super Mario 64</i> *.Z64 ROM with an MD5 of 20B854B239203BAF6C961B850A4A51A2, grab the patch below, and visit the <a href="https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/">online ROM patcher site</a> to get a patched (extended) 64 MB ROM with the MD5: 49DC4B3D07C6A5E9E7405659EA58F4FC.</p>
	<p>Playing this hack briefly is a lot of fun, but it seems to run slowly in large spaces filled with many environmental elements and enemies on RMG and M64py, and it crashes completely on Project 64 after selecting your save file.</p>
	<p>It's a promising start for a fantastically fun hack, and hopefully BusterDoggy will take steps to make improvements in future revisions, perhaps even fixing console compatibility.</p>
