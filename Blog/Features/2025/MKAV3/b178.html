	<h4>Patching Practices</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>In order to play this ROM hack, all you need to do is patch the vanilla <i>Mario Kart 64 (U) [!].z64</i> ROM (MD5: 3A67D9986F54EB282924fCA4CD5F6DFF) with the provided .bps file linked in the YouTube video, and you can use Marc Robledo's fantastic online patcher <a href="https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/">HERE</a> to do so.</p>
	<p>The resulting 21 MB ROM is ready to rock and I'm going to be giving this one a massive play through, and I'll be reviewing it as soon as I'm done, so keep 'em peeled for that!</p>
