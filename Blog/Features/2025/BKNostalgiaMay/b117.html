	<h4>64-bit Sentimentality</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Prolific N64 ROM hacker and retro enthusiast, <a href="https://x.com/Markus_Kurko">Markus Kurko</a>, has recently announced that his latest <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> overhaul project is due to arrive in May!</p>

	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>After a tough weekend fixing more bugs than I expected, I can finally announce that development on BK Nostalgia 64 is complete!</p>
	<p>There are still a couple of weeks of extra testing left to look for minor bugs and polish things here and there, but if nothing major pops up again, I think I'll have the trailer ready with a definitive release date by the end of April.</p>
	<p>I also still need to record the video guide so everything is ready for release day.</p>
	<p>I just want to thank you all for your patience and support; without you, I'm not sure this project would have been possible.</p>
	<p>Big hug!</p>

	<p>Kurko has previously dropped several teasers showcasing environments and gameplay ideas for this mod from as far back as 2020. He then put out a tantalising five-minute teaser specifically for the "BK Beta" content of the Nostalgia mod on the 8th of March 2024. The gameplay within gives a fascinating look at how the <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> beta footage differentiated itself from the final game and some super-cool customised secrets!</p>

	<p>The <i>BK Nostalgia</i> mod looks to be something incredible for N64 fans to pore over when the final product lands. Thankfully, it will work on real hardware as well as emulators, so I will be playing it on everything possible to absorb as much of the nostalgia as I can!</p>

	<p>The project started as a series of levels for people to play during the coronavirus lockdown.</p>
	<p>The first level was released in April 2020, and I added the other levels little by little.</p>
	<p>By early 2021, I already had all the levels, so I thought about making a small Hub World to bring them all together and renamed it BK Nostalgia 64.</p>
	<p>There wasn't much more ambition than adding Yoshi's Story level and little else. However, the project grew, and a programmer joined, so we expanded everything.</p>
	<p>At the end of 2021, I put the project on standby because many of the programming things were unfinished, and I had to wait.</p>
	<p>In 2023, seeing that the programmer had completely abandoned the project, I took it back, modifying and adapting everything so I could finish it myself without outside help. I've been working on it since January 2024 until now.</p>
	<p>By the way, the original Pokemon Snap world of Stay At Home was created by Bynine (creator of Cave of Dreams).</p>
	<p>For Nostalgia 64, I've reworked the models to update them a bit, but the ideas and level design are his. Btw, for the music Riposte helped me with tons of songs, arranging new Midis and fixing some old of mine.</p>
