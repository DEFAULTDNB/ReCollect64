	<p>Three years ago Sorra1, aka Animenatik Bob, started a modification for <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> entitled "The Corrupted Jiggies", which promised to contain 9 completely new worlds, a new hubworld, 97 jiggys, 910 notes, custom music, new mechanics, 4 new transformations, and secrets after 100%.</p>
	<p>The first announcement was posted in July of 2023 and can be seen here:</p>

	<p>The premise is that Grunty is back and more powerful than ever. Your world is in danger, and she is hell-bent on getting revenge on our heroes for what befell her in the original game. Ultimately, you need to stop her again, but this time across several new worlds and with 4 brand-spanking-new transformations and some interesting-looking mechanics!</p>
	<p>Two years later and we have been given a second trailer and a release date, which is way closer than you think!</p>

	<p>Yes, on the <b>16th of August</b> we will finally be able to play this stunning modification, and notably, the updated blurb states that a full secret tenth world will be available after 100% completion!</p>
	<p>Trailer two shows a huge amount of progression from the first one, with some incredibly detailed locations to explore and improved mechanics that should make the game extremely fun to play. I am very much looking forward to checking this ROM hack out, because fans are providing updated adventures for the IP, doing what Rare isn't. Plus, I am a huge fan of the bear and bird duo!</p>
	<p>Keep your diaries clear this weekend so that you can enjoy this hack in full, and keep your eyes peeled for the official ReCollect64 review, right here, very soon!</p>
