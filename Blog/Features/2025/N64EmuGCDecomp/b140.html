	<h4>Games Cubed</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>In 2003, Nintendo brought out <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Master Quest</i> and <i>The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition</i> for the GameCube. These discs contained the classic Ocarina of Time, a version with tougher dungeons, more enemies, and beefed-up bosses, and the latter contained a couple of NES <i>Zelda</i> games but also included <i>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</i>. These games were not ports; they were ROMs, and the discs contained emulators.</p>
	<p>Today, some 22 years later, the first GameCube decompilation effort by ZeldaRET (Zelda Reverse Engineering Team) has successfully produced the 100% complete source code for the N64 emulator that powered those games on the cubic system.</p>
	<p>The emulator is attributed to Stephen Lee, a software engineer at Nintendo of America in the early 2000s, who built a functional emulator specifically for the two N64 Zelda titles. His work would also be used for N64 emulation on Wii Virtual Console, where the 21 released titles each had a bespoke, tweaked emulator bundled with them.</p>

	<p>The information was shared by Twitter user RobloxVoiceChat, who is focused on security research, reverse engineering, and Roblox:</p>

	<p>This emulator was used in the releases of Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask on the GameCube. Of course, the zeldaret team was behind this decomp project.</p>
	<p>The original emulator had full dwarf information non some versions, which really allowed this one to be ahead of everyone.</p>
	<p>The thing that really pushed this one ahead was MetroTRK.</p>
	<p>On older versions of the Metrowerks PPC compiler, there is a bug fix which in short would cause MetroTRK to become unmatchable. Someone from the oot-gc team patched the compiler to make it matchable again.</p>

	<h4>Achievement Unlocked</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With Nintendo 64 emulation being carried by <a href="https://github.com/emukidid/Wii64">Cube64</a> and <a href="https://github.com/extremscorner/not64">Not64</a>, both ports of Mupen64 by team Wii64 and Extrems, there aren't many options for playing N64 ROMs on the GameCube system.</p>
	<p>The decompilation of this emulator may yield some interesting information that might prove useful in bolstering existing emulators, but by and large, this is more of a technical achievement, rather than something that will immediately benefit the system when it comes to N64 emulation.</p>
	<p>That being said, this also marks the first GameCube title to be fully decompiled, which is a notable achievement for both scenes nonetheless.</p>
