	<p>With season three of Netflix's hit TV series <i>Squid Game</i> hitting our TV screens this week, it's only fitting that someone has recreated the tension-inducing mini-games in a mod for <i>Super Mario 64</i>'s PC port. Using a system of points instead of the â‚©45.6 billion prize, the aim is to rank highly in each game and rack up the most points, becoming the ultimate winner of the titular game.</p>
	<p>Drenchy recently commissioned a team of modders to recreate a selection of games from the series, including "Red Light, Green Light", "Mingle", and "Glass Bridge", as well as new games such as "Star Steal" (capture the flag), "King of the Hill", "Lights Out" (fighting in the sleeping quarters), and finally "The Final Fight", where you must topple your opponent out of the arena in a best-of-three face-off.</p>

	<p>The arenas are instantly recognisable with a selection of backrooms and staging areas that you will appreciate too. The overall look and mechanics of the mod are also spot-on, as even "Red Light, Green Light" is totally terrifying with a giant Toad taking center stage and barking orders. The increasingly competitive game modes quickly become frantic battles of nerve and determination.</p> 
	<p><a href="https://mods.sm64coopdx.com/members/emilyemmi.18/">EmilyEmmi provided work on programming and maps</a>, <a href="https://x.com/biobak64">Biobak</a> and Woissile also worked on maps, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Murioz">Murioz</a> took care of the sound side of things. All told, the team has put together quite the spectacle in emulating the format and backdrops we find synonymous with the TV show. Check out the pre-release VOD here:</p>

	<h4>Deluxe Multiplayer</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Danidev">Danidev's Crab Game</a>, Drench Game 64 utilises <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b9">Super Mario 64 Coop Deluxe</a>, which I have covered <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b99">a few times</a> on ReCollect64, so that the mod is able to be played with relative ease by up to 16 players on PC.</p>
	<p>All you need to do is head over to the site, grab and load the files. It goes without saying that this mod uses the PC port as a base and is therefore not playable on console, even in a lone player capacity.</p>
	<p>Drenchy also has a whole slew of fascinating game mods demonstrated on his YouTube channel, so if this one has whetted your appetite, I highly recommend you go check the rest out!</p>
