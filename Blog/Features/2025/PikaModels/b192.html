	<p>Created by Atsuko Nishida for <i>Pokemon Blue</i> and <i>Red</i> in 1996, Pikachu quickly became the face of Pokemon and the poster child for countless ensuing games, films, card sets and various pieces of merchandise around the world.</p>
	<p>As a character, Pikachu featured in not one, not three, but six games on the Nintendo 64, and today we are going to check out the models, their fidelity and their authenticity towards the lovable electrified mouse.</p>
	<h4>Shocking Stature</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Pikachu's first outing for the N64 came by way of <i>Pikachu Genki Dechu</i>, or <i>Hey you, Pikachu!</i> In late 1998, this game allowed players to shout at Pikachu with a VRU (voice recognition unit), barking commands and asking probing questions without a care in the world, eventually releasing him back into the wild after roughly a year of torturous in-game inquisition.</p>
	<p>Sporting just 458 vertices across 752 triangles, this model is not the worst there is, and I should hope not, because he was the focus character in the game and therefore should be as good as possible at any angle while playing. I like this rendition, it's more vibrant, cartoony, and less CHONKY than the other incarnations.</p>

	<h4>Fighting Fit</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>On August 1st, 1998, Nintendo released <i>Pocket Monsters Stadium</i> in Japan. The high-end model used 723 triangles and the low-poly model had just 300, but regardless, it leaves the little furry dude looking decidedly portly.</p>
	<p>Given that the game contained 42 of the titular pocketable creatures, I can see why this mesh was so minimal in its construction. Nintendo had to think about saving space on every model to fit as many as was humanly possible at the time.</p>

	</center>
	<p>Come 2000, <i>Pokemon Stadium 2</i> was released to the rapturous approval of the fans. This time around, Nintendo had managed to shoehorn in an astounding 251 of the menagerie for players to capture, collect and trade with friends.</p>
	<p>Interestingly, the exact same model was used for <i>Pocket Monsters Stadium, Pokemon Stadium</i> and <i>Pokemon Stadium 2</i>, but the technology improved to allow more creatures per cartridge. The first games used a 256 Mb cartridge, whereas the last deployed the biggest 512 Mb cartridge that existed. Very few games took advantage of this sized cartridge; only <i>Conker's Bad Fur Day, Resident Evil 2, SimCity 64</i> and <i>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</i> were treated to the 512 Mb capacity option.</p>
	<p>The high-poly model is phenomenally versatile, and allowed Pikachu to perform lots of moves and flourishes when used in combat. This bozo could even surf!</p>

	<h4>Smash and Grab</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Pikachu also appeared in <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> (1999), a game that pitted his fighting prowess against actual formidable warriors, not just elementally enhanced beasts with moist soil or sharp grass powers, or whatever. With just 338 triangles and 295 vertices, I feel that this model is one of the best in <i>Super Smash Bros.</i>, as it conveys the character's recognisable silhouette succinctly.</p>
	<p>As a vocal hater of the "Smash aesthetic", I actually think that this one is a decent rendition of the character. Where more complicated characters such as Samus and Link look particularly awful, this rendition of the most famous Pokemon on the planet looks a lot like him, if a little squat and stout. I almost never chose Pikachu as my main fighter, as battering competitors with Link, Fox or Captain Falcon was by far way cooler in my opinion!</p>

	<h4>Snapped Up</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>1999's <i>Pokemon Snap</i> held, oddly, only 63 out of the available 151 Pokemon of the era. Why not 64 is anyone's guess; perhaps it was also due to the constraints of its 128 Mb cartridge, but the model for Pikachu in <i>Pokemon Snap</i> boasts just 352 triangles and 237 vertices, the lowest amount seen in an N64 title, but yet he's still easily distinguishable!</p>
	<p>As a Pokemon-avoider, I honestly found so much fun in <i>Pokemon Snap</i> that I really didn't find in the TV show or the collect-and-battle-style games. I make no bones about the fact that these are probably great games, but Pokemon as a pursuit never hooked me in a way that IPs like Ninja Turtles or Super Mario ever did. Snap was my guilty pleasure, chilling out and collecting the best images of the various flora and fauna possible, in between frenetic multiplayer staples such as <i>GoldenEye, Perfect Dark, Mario Kart 64, Wave Race 64, 1080 Snowboarding</i> and the gore-filled blood-soaked <i>Turok</i> games with mates.</p>

	<p>Pikachu endures as a fan-favourite character, and we will no doubt continue to see his image on a plethora of Pokemon's commodities and promotional material around the globe.</p>
