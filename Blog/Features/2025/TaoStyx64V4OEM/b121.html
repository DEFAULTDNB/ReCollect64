	<p>I have been working in close collaboration with our friend @RockerGaming to make something very beautiful!  https://x.com/RockerGameMod/status/1912912706631356514?s=19</p>
	<p>We have made a revision to the v3 Steel Joystick.  We're calling this new revision the "v4 OEM Pro" joystick to distinguish it from the v4 Slim joystick.  It will be in stainless steel as well.</p>
	<p>We have been working on this very intensively for quite some time now, but we're finally to the point were it is ready for release!</p>
	<p>The v4 OEM Pro was designed specifically to be used in Rocker's module and was designed specifically for speedrunning.  We've discovered performance enhancements with Rocker's bowl and gate that far surpass anything that we can reproduce with new OEM bowls and gates.</p>
	<p>Despite being designed for speedrunning, I have also personally found that this joystick performs very well for smash as compared to the v3 steel joystick.  There is a lot of potential to be discovered in the v4 OEM Pro, and I'm excited to see what people find!</p>
	<p>One of the memes that I have been using while Rocker and I communicated back and forth was the archon from StarCraft. :PowerOverwhelmingArchon: To me, this symbolized working together as one to push our own limits to make the best possible N64 speedrunning combination yet.</p>
	<p>We're pleased to announce the TaoStyx64 V4 OEM Pro!  ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ </p>
	<p>It will be going up for sale on Rocker's Etsy this Friday.  We wanted to make sure that all parts were available at the same location, so we chose Rocker's Etsy as the sale location since he also sells the bowl and gate there.  We'll have bundled discounts available for those parts if purchased with a Tao v4 OEM Pro. :PsychedelicThumbsup: </p>
	<p>We've included a table if you'd like to see what's changed in the revision.</p>

	<h4>A Speedrunners Dream</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The sticks feature a unique adjustment system to allow players to customise the feel and output for their specific needs. It also features OEM gate and bowl compatibility, as well as a tongue-and-groove tapered cap to ensure stability during play and a simple method to swap them over as you wish. All you need to provide is the spring, encoder wheels, encoder PCB, lower housing and gears from an OEM controller so that you can build your own module with any combination of these redesigned (stick/bowl/gate) components, and drop it all into your controller.</p>
	<p>As part of Project Renaissance, the components have been tested by speedrunners and competition-level players with incredible results. Using the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b26">portable N64 test rig</a> or any controller testing app as a guide, you can see that any variances are extremely small in comparison with parts built by Nintendo, meaning you get rock-solid performance with parts that are all guaranteed to work in conjunction with the OEM modules built into any first-party controller.</p>

	<p>The steel bowls are multi-material with a hardened insert for durability, while the gates are expertly notched and made from injection-moulded high-quality polycarbonate that features a set-screw design to fit with existing OEM assembly.</p>
	<p>The level of technology and stringent micro-measurements has led the project to become as good, if not better, than OEM in terms of tolerances. The bowl housing is also now being injection moulded, as opposed to 3D printed, making it more consistent with benchmarking across the board.</p>
