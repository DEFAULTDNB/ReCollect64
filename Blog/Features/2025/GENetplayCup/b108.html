	<h4>Shaken, and Stirred</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As a final update to <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b71" target="_blank">the previous post</a>, the <i>GoldenEye Licence to Kill Netplay Cup V</i> tournament has now come to a crescendo, and the winners and statistics can now be celebrated!</p>
	<p>The competition has seen the 22 participants whittled down to the final four over the past seven weeks and featured over 1350 kills and some truly impressive kill-to-death ratios, such as TK Cup V host TH126's incredible 1.47 K/D and Graslu00's amazingly accurate 9.67 average kills per match, through the entirety of the event.</p>

	<p>The competition winner this year is <b>Graslu00</b>, so congratulations to him for hammering home "three-peat" in the GE LTK Netplay Cup series, with gold in III, IV and now V on the bounce.</p>
	<p>The grand final saw Grasul00 (Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov) face off against TH126 (Alek Trevelyan) in an incredibly tense 10/6, 10/4, 8/10, 8/10, 10/9 match for the ages, across Caves, Complex, Stack, Basement, and finally Egyptian. The tension while watching the matchup was palpable, with neither player willing to give any ground to the other; it could not have been a more intense and tactic-fuelled finale between the two highly-skilled players.</p>
	<p>Second place, taken by none other than TH126 himself, only succumbed to Graslu00's silenced PP7 during the cup's edge-of-the-seat finale. Not only did TH126 host, stream and commentate the entire series, but he managed to eke out a silver trophy to boot, an incredible effort!</p> 
	<p>Honourable mentions go to Grim for coming third and EternallyAries for taking fourth place while also achieving the highest number of kills and deaths in the contest with 180 and 138, respectively.</p>

	<h4>Winners Circle</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The three top winners each take home much-deserved USD/Bitcoin or gift card prizes, with first place bagging $100, second Â£30, and third $20, with Graslu00 earning a bonus $15 for a killstreak of 12 and Grim pocketing an extra $25 for a whopping 25 kills with the cougar magnum in the bracket stages!</p> 
	<p>Congratulations to everyone who participated in the contest; it has been a nail-biting few weeks, which I have been avidly watching and <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#LTKCupV">attempting to track</a> over in the "Scores" section of ReCollect64. Thankfully, TH126 sent me over the full breakdown of stats with kills, deaths, K/D ratio and more, which I am mirroring here for everyone to see.</p>

	<h4>James Bond Will Return</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>A massive thank you once again to TH126 for his brilliantly action-packed contest; this is the first one I have actively managed to watch thoroughly, and I certainly look forward to spectating the next one when that gets announced at some point next year.</p>
	<p>Graslu00 has since mentioned that "It's time to cool down", having won every GoldenEye Source tournament and league since 2014 and every console-based cup since 2022. His announcement also stated that he was "considering retirement from multiplayer competitions" going forward, so it appears that he might be planning on taking a much-needed break and focusing on playing for fun rather than winning for the foreseeable future.</p>
