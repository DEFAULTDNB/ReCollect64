	<h4>Game Saver</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As DIY projects go, I'm a huge fan of the Raspberry Pi family of boards. Each one has a plethora of projects to flash to them and so many interesting uses that it boggles the mind. Zwenergy has recently unveiled their CPAK2040-Zero, a memory pak for the Nintendo 64 that harnesses the power of RPi Zero and has the storage capacity of ten memory cards in one.</p>
	<p>Zwenergy is perhaps best known for their <a href="https://github.com/zwenergy/gbaHD">open-source gbaHD consoliser project</a> that converts Nintendo's 32-bit handheld system into a fully-fledged home console, complete with an FPGA clock for timing and a Super Nintendo controller socket for comfortable TV play.</p>
	<p>As we know, memory doesn't last forever, so the brilliance of this project is having an option that is affordable, doesn't rely on batteries and can be made at home. This serves to extend the joy we can get from our games and systems.</p>

	<p>The main idea of CPAK2040 is to a have a simple, cheap and easily DIY-able controller pak alternative for the N64 which is non-volatile (meaning not relying on a battery to keep the controller pak data like the original based on SRAM). For this, an RP2040-Zero board is used, as it is widely available, cheap and easy to solder even for beginners.</p>
	<p>A regular RP2040-Zero board has a 2 MB Flash, whereas a single N64 controller pak has a capacity of 32 kB. The software running on the RP2040 to emulate the controller pak only takes up a fraction of the available Flash memory, hence quite many "virtual controller paks" can be stored in the Pico's Flash. By default, the CPAK2040 holds 10 "virtual controller paks", as a more efficient navigating method needs to implemented to better use a larger number of controller paks.</p>

	<p>The Gerber files found on the GitHub project link are are essentially the PCB instructions, and once you have that made (or obtained from a vendor), you can crack on with the project, soldering the Pi to the board with the diagram below.</p>
	<p>The CPAK also makes use of the USB-C built into the Pi to allow you to copy saves effortlessly to a PC for backup or to use on emulators. It should go without saying, but do not plug in the USB-C while the CPAK is in your controller and connected to a powered-on console; you may blow the thing up because it is being fed a voltage from the console directly.</p>

	<h4>As Easy As Pi</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Prior to the CPAK2040-Zero, Zwenergy had worked on a CPAK2040 that utilised the Raspberry Pi 2040 Pico board, which weighed in at just $4 (the Wi-Fi version is not necessary). Allowing users to make use of Zero boards means that budding builders have yet another option to fashion an awesome new feature-packed memory pak, although the price of the Zero is usually slightly more than the Pico.</p>
	<p>Flashing the device is as easy as holding down the BOOTSEL button and dragging and dropping the *.UF2 file. Upon boot, you'll need to hold down the START button on the controller when starting a game to access the memory card manager and repair the card for first use. After this, you're free to use each bank of the virtual memory card to your heart's content. Clicking the selector button on the pak simulates an eject when the pak can be changed over.</p>

	<p>Each "virtual controller pak" on the CPAK2040 has a lifetime of around 100,000 writes, which should last an average user 27 years before you get anywhere near the theoretical limit. Once you have the CPACK2040 operational, don't forget that you can use <a href="https://bryc.github.io/mpkedit/">MPKEdit online</a> to easily delete, clone, or move individual saves too. It's a fantastic utility for any memory pak user!</p>
	<p>It is wonderful to see the N64 memory pak getting a fresh lease of life in 2025 and more fascinating to see how devices like the Pi can be used within them. So far there is a <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r12">cartridge dumper</a>, a <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r7">flash cartridge</a>, and this Memory Pak project that utilise this family of tiny flashable project boards. I can't wait to see what other N64-related Pi projects come out next!</p>
