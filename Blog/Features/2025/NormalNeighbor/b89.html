	<p>At ReCollect64, I like to change the pace occasionally. Today I'm in a creative kind of mood, so I wanted to share something that I spotted a few weeks ago. Around New Year, in my feed, I saw some incredible low-poly visuals made by <a href="https://x.com/PixelNeighbor" target="_blank">Normal Neighbor</a>. I immediately got in contact with them, and due to the relentless onwards march of time, it's only now that I have eked out some spare time to get this shared with you all!</p>
	<p>Normal Neighbor specialises in digital artwork and motion graphics with a nostalgic retro twist. I have cherry-picked the best 3D N64-related content here for you to see because they're far too cool to not share with everyone. I love to promote cool things, so take your time, put your feet up, make a hot drink, and scroll through this wistful gallery at a cosy and leisurely pace.</p>

	<p>The level of intricacy on display here is stunning. The colours are bang on, and the details on the cartridges, the controllers, and the console itself are fantastic. When I first bought my N64, I had a grey controller with the system, and I bought a second green one, so this animation definitely hits me square in the feels with a blast of memories.</p>

	<p>Here is a close-up on the controller used in that first video. It has an animated stick, the A and B buttons are being pressed, and even the end of the cable has the 3-pin connector textured onto it. The trident controller epitomises the 90s for me, sitting in my room playing <i>Super Mario 64</i>, and <i>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, while patiently waiting for Channel 5 to launch!</i></p>

	<p>Here is Super Smash Bros. in all of its stylised glory. The box art is well-observed and the overall colouration is spot-on. The game peeps in and out, and the whole thing has a cell-shaded outline that I really like. I never been the strongest advocate for SSB, because I was a big <i>Tekken 3</i> and <i>Street Fighter II</i> player, but nowadays I definitely see the sentimentality people have for the game. The original and <i>Smash Remix</i> are high on my list to review, but I have a list as long as my arm to get through first.</p>

	<p>This Majora's Mask one sings to me because I am a huge fan of this Zelda game and Skull Kid. The mask looks proportionally perfect, while the musical annotation and Tatl and Tael are animated so beautifully. The colours are very iconic and instantly recognisable, and the gold cartridge completes the whole bundle.</p>
	<p>Normal Neighbor has a huge selection of material revolving around pixel portrait character art and pop culture video game art, as well as pieces focusing on interesting consoles and technology with 90s/00s aesthetics. It's all on their Twitter, Bluesky, and Instagram pages, so please go check them out if you're into these brilliantly reminiscent vibes!</p>
