	<h4>Engine Ignition</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Whilst scouring the internet for the latest dank memes, I happened to stumble upon an incredible project by Walfrido that aims not only to bring a fantastic-sounding adventure to the N64 but also supports other consoles such as 3DO, PS1, Sega Saturn, and the Dreamcast, with the possibility of porting to more consoles too!</p>
	<p><i>Noah and the Poohloudies</i> is the work of solo developer Walfrido, aka "misscelan", and is a vibrant platforming title where you play as Noah, a rescue robot with unique abilities which allow him to merge with the other robotic inhabitants to gain their powers, all whilst battling the overarching time crunch of an ominous and fast-approaching meteorite. This synopsis alone has me hooked and intrigued because there's so much that can be done with such an intricate system of abilities and a colourful cast of characters. I cannot wait to find out more!</p>
	<p>Utilising an entirely bespoke engine that began life around 2021 and was rewritten entirely in 2023, it looks extremely capable, and the fact that it's easily transferrable across so many platforms is testament to the developers' incredible devotion to their creation.</p>
	<p>The latest N64 tech demo, which is currently constructed with the powerhouse open-source SDK <a href="https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon">Libdragon</a>, currently delivers rather good-looking triple-buffered 320x240 resolution visuals with just one frame of input delay, though the developer plans to improve the current N64 progress with stable 30FPS frame rates by utilising N64-specific math and clever techniques, such as using frame delta rather than fixed-rate frame updates, that will optimise the smoothness of gameplay throughout. Implementing high-resolution textures later on will also make the game look even sharper!</p>
	<p>The current trailer demonstrates that the N64 iteration has options for toggling v-sync, dithering, and antialiasing, as well as Z-buffering, and it runs at around 20-25 FPS on N64. The PS1 version, built with PSn00bSDK, runs around 30 FPS locked or 40-60 FPS unlocked, and the 3DO version, while in its extremely early stages, runs very slowly on the 1993 ARM60-based 12.5 MHz processor, but Walfrido is determined to dig deeper into getting the game running on par with the other versions in progress.</p>

	<h4>Forging Features</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The work-in-progress gameplay already resembles that of titles such as <i>Super Mario 64</i>, <i>Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards</i> and <i>Space Station Silicon Valley</i>, with platforming across familiarly styled environments (*cough* SM64 and OOT *cough*) while collecting abilities from other characters to enhance Noah, the ever-beaming protagonist.</p>
	<p>I recently contacted Walfrido and enquired as to any specifics they were willing to share. Here are a selection of details currently planned for the game:</p>
	<div class="container">
	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>The meteorite's influence causes the "Poohloudies" to malfunction, and attack you, turning the very robots you're trying to rescue into your enemies. But you can't harm them-instead, you must jump on them to "catch" them in your backpack. Once inside, they grant you special abilities.</p>
	<p>While in your backpack, the Poohloudies may need food, water or even medicine if they fall ill. If their needs aren't met, they wont be able to help you-and in the worst case, they could die, forcing you to restart the level.</p>
	<p>Along the way, you'll also need to gather your main collectible: your "fuel". Collecting enough of it is essential to travel between planets and continue your mission.</p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
	</div>
	<p>With work currently focusing on core subsystems for the engine, much of the above is subject to change, especially with the development team of one, Walfrido, only able to chip away at it in their spare time.</p>
	<p>Though a playable demo has not been released yet, the overall progress is making terrific strides in getting the core gameplay actionable over a selection of platforms, and, hopefully, we will see something playable for our flash carts somewhere down the line.</p>
	<p>Previous trailers available on the YouTube channel, linked below, show that the game has been in active development for over 5 years now, and the core mechanics, design language and action look extremely well forged, meaning that <i>Noah and the Poohloudies</i> is shaping up nicely to provide gamers something truly unique to look forward to when it does eventually land on all those retro consoles!</p>
