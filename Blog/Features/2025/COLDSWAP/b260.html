	<h4>Rare Release</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Gregg Mayle, of Rare fame, has just dropped one of the best Christmas presents an N64-era Rare fan could have hoped for. Last night he shared internal documents from the production of <i>Banjo-Tooie</i> that detail "Coldswap", also known as the "Stop 'N Swap" feature that was merely myth and legend in the playgrounds of the late 90s!</p>

	<p><b>Explanation</b></p>
	<p>The Coldswap will allow objects in Banjo-Kazooie & DK64 to be activated from Banjo-Tooie. These objects are then retrieved from Banjo-Kazooie & DK64 and taken back to Banjo-Tooie, where they will allow the player access to special features.</p>
	<p><b>Models / Graphics Needed</b></p>
	<p>In order to do this, certain scenes and graphics from Banjo-Kazooie & DK64 will have to be recreated or duplicated and included in Banjo-Tooie. They are as follows:</p>
	<p><b>From Banjo-Kazooie:</b></p>
	<p>+ A recreation of the scene showing Sharkfood Island rising up out of the sea in Treasure Trove Cove.</p>
	<p>+ A recreation of the scene showing the tomb door opening in Gobi's Valley.</p>
	<p>+ A recreation of the scene showing the Secret Egg appearing in Mad Monster Mansion's bathroom.</p>
	<p>+ A recreation of the scene showing the blocked barrel clearing in Mad Monster Mansion's cellar.</p>
	<p>+ A recreation of the scene showing the Secret Egg appearing on the Captain's bed in Rusty Bucket Bay.</p>
	<p>+ A recreation of the scene showing the Secret Egg appearing on Nabnut's table in Click Clock Wood.</p>
	<p>+ The 3 different coloured Secret Eggs as seen in scenes 3,5 and 6.</p>
	<p><b>From DK64:</b></p>
	<p>+ A recreation of the scene showing the fridge that contains the Ice Key opening in DK's hut.</p>
	<p>+ A recreation of the scene showing the glass case that contains the Gold DK Bust shattering.</p>
	<p>+ The Ice Key.</p>
	<p>+ The Gold DK Bust.</p>
	<p><b>The Secret Eggs</b></p>
	<p>+ The player must find and activate any of the six Secret Egg switches hidden on Spiral Mountain in Banjo-Tooie.</p>
	<p>+ A recreated Banjo-Tooie cut sequence shows the relevant Egg appearing or event happening to allow access to an Egg in Banjo-Kazooie.</p>
	<p>+ Once this sequence has finished, Bottles will explain how the Coldswap works. He will repeat this message if you return to any of the molehills near the switches and speak to him.</p>
	<p>+ The player must then switch off Banjo-Tooie and plug in Banjo-Kazooie within the allowed time limit.</p>
	<p>+ The player then plays Banjo-Kazooie and collects the Secret Egg.</p>
	<p>+ The player must then switch off Banjo-Kazooie and plug in Banjo-Tooie within the allowed time limit.</p>
	<p>+ If the process is done successfully, when the game restarts Bottles will tell DK to look on his Pause Screen 'View Totals' page. The game brings up the desired information automatically, where the Secret Egg will have been added to the 'Stop n' Swap screen.</p>
	<p>+ Once any game slot on Banjo-Tooie has collected any Secret Egg (Egg 1') from Banjo-Kazooie and has successfully transferred it back to Banjo-Tooie all the game slots on Banjo-Tooie will now have 'Egg l', as this is a cartridge to cartridge feature, not a slot to slot one (unfortunately). However, to prevent the other two game slot players getting 'Egg 1' without doing any work, we will make it so that they have to follow the same switch hitting process before they get their reward. When either of the other game slot players do this, 'Egg 1' will simply be added to the 'Stop n' Swap' screen as before.</p>
	<p>+ The same process applies for the other 5 Secret Eggs.</p>
	<p>+ When the player now enters Heggy's Egg Shed, Banjo will automatically throw the Secret Egg onto it's predetermined nest, where it can be hatched to reveal the special feature inside.</p>
	<p><b>The Ice Key</b></p>
	<p>+ The Ice Key will be transferred from Banjo-Kazooie into DK64, where it is placed in a fridge in DK's Hut after it had been used. Banjo-Tooie will retrieve the Key from here.</p>
	<p>+ The player must activate an undecided feature in Banjo-Tooie.</p>
	<p>+ A recreated Banjo-Tooie cut sequence shows the fridge door opening on DK64, allowing access to the Ice Key inside.</p>
	<p>+ Once this sequence has finished, Bottles will explain how the Coldswap works. He will repeat this message if you return to the molehill where the undecided feature was activated from.</p>
	<p>+ The player must then switch off Banjo-Tooie and plug in DK64 within the allowed time limit.</p>
	<p>+ The player then plays DK64 and collects the Ice Key.</p>
	<p>+ The player must then switch off DK64 and plug in Banjo-Tooie within the allowed time limit.</p>
	<p>+ If the process is done successfully, when the game restarts Bottles will tell DK to look on his Pause Screen 'View Totals page. The game brings up the desired information automatically, where the Ice Key will have been added to the 'Stop n' Swap screen.</p>
	<p>+ The player must now go into the Hailfire Peaks level on Banjo-Tooie and to the location of the ice safe that contains the Super Jiggy. When they get there, a cut sequence shows the Ice Key flying out of Banjo's backpack and into the keyhole. The safe opens, which allows the player access to the Super Jiggy inside.</p>
	<p>+ As soon as this sequence finishes it is followed by another. The key disappears from the keyhole, and the scene changes to wherever we decide to put the Ice Key next for retrieval into the 'Next N64 game'.</p>
	<p>+ The player can then collect the Super Jiggy. This is added to the Jigsaw totals screen.</p>
	<p>+ Bottles pops up with a congratulatory message, telling the player it must do something good if you can now complete everything else. When the player has done this, they will have 101 Jiggies instead of instead of 100 and will get to see the special 'out takes' ending.</p>
	<p>+ When Banjo-Tooie receives the appropriate signal from 'Next N64 Game', the location where the Ice Key was placed becomes accessible, so that the player can unplug 'Next N64 Game', plug in Banjo-Tooie, collect the Ice Key, unplug Banjo-Tooie and finally plug Next N64 Game' back in. The Ice Key will now be transferred to 'Next N64 Game'.</p>
	<p><b>The Gold DK Bust</b></p>
	<p>+ There is a Gold DK Bust in DK64, located in a glass case on the Creepy Castle level. This can't be got [sic] during normal play.</p>
	<p>+ The player must activate an undecided feature in Banjo-Tooie.</p>
	<p>+ A recreated Banjo-Tooie cut sequence shows the glass case shattering on DK64, allowing access to the Gold DK Bust inside.</p>
	<p>+ Once this sequence has finished, Bottles will explain how the Coldswap works. He will repeat this message if you return to the molehill where the undecided feature was activated from.</p>
	<p>+ The player must then switch off Banjo-Tooie and plug in DK64 within the allowed time limit.</p>
	<p>+ The player then plays DK64 and collects the Gold DK Bust.</p>
	<p>+ The player must then switch off DK64 and plug in Banjo-Tooie within the allowed time limit.</p>
	<p>+ If the process is done successfully, when the game restarts Bottles will tell DK to look in the Multiplayer options on the Game Selection Screen. Donkey Kong (and possibly others from DK64) will now be available as controllable multiplayer characters.</p>
	<p><b>The Gold Banjo Bust</b></p>
	<p>+ There is also an undecided location in Banjo-Tooie where there is a Gold Banjo Bust. This can be seen but not got by the player during the game.</p>
	<p>+ When Banjo-Tooie receives the appropriate signal from 'Next N64 Game', the location where the Gold Banjo Bust was placed becomes accessible, so that the player can unplug 'Next N64 Game', plug in Banjo-Tooie, collect the Bust, unplug Banjo-Tooie and finally plug 'Next N64 Game' back in. The Bust will now be transferred to 'Next N64 Game'.</p>
	<p>+ The Gold Banjo Bust could be a different object if required. If it remains a Bust, the feature it activates when it is transferred to the 'Next N64 Game' should have something to do with Banjo.</p>

	<h4>Secret Sauce</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With the mechanic famously being nixed by Nintendo due to revisions of the Nintendo 64 hardware itself becoming faster and more efficient, Stop 'N Swap's whole ethos of tearing out the cart and replacing it as fast as humanly possible before the memory was wiped was entirely halted.</p>
	<p>This never prevented school kids from whispering around the classrooms that there was something you could do with the Ice Key or those coloured eggs, but today, as an adult, it's incredible to learn about the plans for one of the most creative ways to connect games, before the internet and DLC even existed. The mere mention of Donkey Kong as a playable character in <i>Banjo-Tooie</i> fills me with glee, though the consistent "Next N64 game" reference does make me a little sad that we never got to see <i>Banjo-Threeie</i> come to fruition, even after Rare's shift to Microsoft and the passing of almost three decades.</p>
	<p>I always wondered why they simply didn't write the information about what you had collected in <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> to a save file on the Memory Pak, then read it into <i>Banjo-Tooie</i>/<i>Donkey Kong 64</i> at the start to "carry over" the progress and unlock these cheeky little features, something they later implemented in the XBLA re-releases. Regardless, this is some incredible information, and we are now beyond privileged to be able to finally get to absorb it first-hand!</p>
