	<h4>MiSTer Incredible</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>For those who don't know, here's the quick version: Taki Udon is the co-founder of Retro Remake and a creator of budget-friendly MiSTer FPGA hardware. I also mentioned them in the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b47">Alternative N64s</a> piece I did in November last year, highlighting other devices you could use to play N64 games that have sprung up in recent years.</p>
	<p>Taki's latest product, the SuperStation One, is an FPGA PlayStation One built to play PS1 games in high fidelity and with additional modern features such as Bluetooth controllers, HDMI and WiFi built in.</p>
	<p>Yesterday, Taki teased the ability to play N64 games using the SuperStation One directly from an N64 cartridge, which was not on my N64-related 2025 bingo card!</p>
	<p>It's interesting to note that the method used appears to read the entire cartridge to memory first and then load the game via an N64 core. That process is shown to take over 30 seconds for the miniscule 8-megabyte (MB) or 64-megabit (Mb) <i>Super Mario 64</i> cartridge. Imagine how long it would take to run <i>Conker</i> or <i>Resident Evil 2</i>!</p>
	<p>Other devices, such as BennVenn's fantastic <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r6">JoeyN64</a> can be used as a cart reader for emulators such as <a href="https://www.pj64-emu.com/">Project 64</a>, for example, cutting out the need to dump or load the ROM into memory and reading directly from the cart, using it somewhat like an external drive holding a ROM.</p>

	<h4>One N-Sixty More</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With yet another N64-capable FPGA machine entering the fray, players will soon be spoilt for choice. With <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b194">ModRetro's M64</a> and Analogue's 3D both set to land around Christmas time, players could opt for the currently available <a href="https://retroremake.co/products/superstation%E1%B5%92%E2%81%BF%E1%B5%89-batch-3">$199.99 SuperStation One</a>, with whatever attachment comes that facilitates the connection of N64 carts.</p>
	<p>What this connector may come to look like yet is anyone's guess. I like to imagine that should such an N64 adaptor come to fruition, it would resemble either an Action Replay-style L shaped connector that slaps into the back of the PS1's Parallel I/O port or, more likely, something like that of the CD64, whereby an add-on is connected beneath the SuperStation One, and N64 carts are pushed into it, as shown below:</p>

	</center>
	<p>Until the excessive load times are ironed out, which I understand should be very possible, we will have to wait and see exactly how this will materialise for N64 fans.</p>
	<p>Either way, the ability to play physical N64 cartridges on another modern device is another brilliant step towards game preservation. I will be glued to the screen, keeping tabs on its progress to see where Taki and his crew go with this one!</p>
