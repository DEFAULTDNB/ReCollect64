	<h4>Retro Revival</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>It's 2025, and believe it or not, there is another FPGA specialist entering the N64 space and intending to reinvigorate 1996's 64-bit wonder for a modern audience.</p>
	<p>American entrepreneur <a href="https://x.com/PalmerLuckey">Palmer Luckey</a> of ModRetro and previously Oculus fame, before it was sold to Meta (Facebook), posted a somewhat cryptic message to Twitter/X.com this morning that hinted at an N64-shaped announcement from his company in the not-too-distant future.</p>
	<p>With today's <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b37">announcement from Analogue regarding the Analogue 3D's release date slipping from March to July 2025</a>, we now have a situation where more players want a slice of the N64 action, and a little competition never hurt anybody now, did it?</p>

	<h4>Previous Pedigry</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Palmer Luckey is famous for his love of Nintendo consoles, and he was recently quoted as saying he had been working on a portable N64 console. Perhaps the "M" in "M64" stands for mobile?</p>
	<p>My theory is that Hyperkin's ill-fated handheld N64, <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b47">which I covered recently</a>, is the inspiration for the "M64". The image shown above could be the lower half of the instantly recognisable trident controller, with the top purposefully cropped to hide a screen-laden upper half.<p>
	<p><a href="https://x.com/Hyperkin">Hyperkin<a> recently apologised to fans for overpromising and under-delivering on products, and my first, totally N64-biased instinct was that the Hyperkin "Ultra Retron" was the subject of the apology, but it also occurred to me that the portable was also teased and disregarded.</p>
	<p>The fact that ModRetro began and specialises in Game Boy modding and repair, one of the best-selling handheld console brands on the planet, I have to wonder: does this lend further credence toward it being a portable device rather than a strict in-front-of-a-TV home console?</p>

	<p><a href="https://x.com/modretro">Modretro</a> recently blew away the retro console scene with their Chromatic, a Game Boy Color with a distinctly modern build quality but with a lovingly evocative facade. It also comes in a stunning array of colours, something that Analogue has shied away from with the 3D's new look, so hopefully we may see something funtastic-esque!</p>
	<p>Whatever the project may be, I'm sure ModRetro will bring some sublime flair to it, and the team of avid Nintendo 64 fans will respectfully bring us something intelligently nostalgic and extremely playable.</p>
