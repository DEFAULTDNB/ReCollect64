	<p>Following on from their previous releases, the Harbour Masters have once again taken a decompilation project and turned it into a fully functional PC game under the whacky guise of Spaghetti Kart!</p>
	<p><i>Mario Kart 64</i> is the latest release to get the specialist Libultraship treatment, with full modern controller support, silky smooth frame rates, and more, though for anyone wondering, it does not include online multiplayer support.</p>
	<p>Brilliantly, the release also includes a Harbour Masters-themed custom track, a full track editor and importer tools, as well as a host of optional quality-of-life game improving mods:</p>

    <p>Maximum Render Distance</p>
    <p>Removed Support for HaikuOS</p>

	</div>
	<p>In order to play the game on Windows, Linux or even Steam Deck, you simply need to extract the O2R data from a legally obtained USA *.Z64 ROM (MD5: 579C48E211AE952530FFC8738709F078D5DD215E), and run the "Spaghettify.exe". In-game, if you have any custom assets ready to go in your "mods" folder, such as texture enhancement packs, simply press TAB to enable them.</p>
	<p>The port, which is based on the <a href="https://github.com/n64decomp/mk64">decompilation effort</a> I most recently posted about <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b131">back in May</a>, does not include any copyrighted assets, so this phenomenal project should be safe from the Nintendo Ninjas, and hopefully we will see a fully thriving community with more tracks and more players than ever before.</p>
	<p>Though the repository suggests a Nintendo Switch port of <i>Spaghetti Kart</i>, the link is currently dead, so perhaps that will also come in the next few days or weeks!</p>
