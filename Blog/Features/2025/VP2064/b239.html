	<h4>Canned Coin-Ops</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>Viewpoint 2064</i> was a shoot 'em up game developed by Sammy Corporation, ready for release in late 1999 or possibly early 2000. The game was cancelled, and up until yesterday, only a pre-release <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b53">prototype</a> that was found in 2020 was available to play. </p>
	<p>Friend of the site <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#c26">Hard4Games</a> has put together a comparison video that details the main differences within the two known versions, and I have to say that the final version looks stunning in comparison. Check it out for yourself here:</p>

	<h4>Perfect Preservation</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>This is just the latest in a string of quality releases by Hard4Games, who has a track record for finding Nintendo 64 prototypes, dumping them, and preserving them for the world to enjoy.</p>
	<p>Previous releases include <i>Mario Party 3, 007: The World is Not Enough, WinBack: Covert Operations, Rugrats, Deadly Arts/G.A.S.P!! Fighters' NEXTream, RakugaKids, Carnivale: Cenzo's Adventure, X'treme Roller, Tonic Trouble, Cubivore</i>, and even some 64DD games, which included the extremely rare Super Mario 64 Disk Version!</p>
	<p>Who knows what other long lost treasures might come to the surface one day? I personally hope for <i>Rev Limit</i> and <i>Twelve Tales: Conker 64</i>. I won't hold my breath, but you never know, <i>Dinosaur Planet</i> got preserved in 2021, anything is possible!</p>
