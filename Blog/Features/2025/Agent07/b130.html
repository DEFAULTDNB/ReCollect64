	<h4>Buyer Beware</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Would you believe that in the year 2025, companies are sneaking AI-generated slop and blatantly stolen models, music and textures into games, and yet somehow they make it past Sony's quality control standards for the PSN store?</p>
	<p>As initially reported by <a href="https://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/gaming-spy-revenge-agent-007">MI6 HQ</a> back in January, an odd listing for "Agent 007" appeared on the PlayStation store, with a decidedly niche description that attempts to suck the blood of <i>GoldenEye 007</i>. Since then the game's advertising has changed a little, omitting the second "0", possibly in an attempt to fly further under the radar.</p>

	<p><a href="https://iorder.studio/">iOrder SRL</a> has a track record of plagiarising games as well as using underhanded titling and AI-generated trailers to falsly advertise their wares.</p>
	<p>An example of this is <i>OFC - Ultimate Fight Club</i>, which released in Australia in 2024, and uses suspiciously familiar sound effects and falsly advertises features such as ground grappling. After being called out by many streamers as being a direct copy and paste of known scam game <i>MFC: Midnight Fight Club</i>, the game has recieved an average rating of 1.31 out of 5 on the PSN store, with 90% of the 209 ratings marking it just one star.</p>
	<p>Ironically, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/store/ps-store-refund-request/">Sony's refund policy</a> doesn't cover you against game that are terribly made or use stolen assets instead, they require you to have not been downloaded or streamed the content you're requesting a refund for; which you would only come to realise once you get to the end of the game.</p>
	<h4>Asset Theft</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Prolific <i>Goldeneye 007</i> speedrunner, and 2025 LTK Netplay Cup V winner <a href="https://x.com/Graslu00">Graslu00</a>, has recently exposed the truths of Agent 07, and has provided some interesting comparisons as well as some context from the support chatlog.</p>
	<p>Having purchased the game in good faith, it took less than an hour for the FPS enthusiast to beat all 20 levels and gain all 23 trophies. Noting that the final level was almost an exact replica of <i>GoldenEye</i>'s Dam level, he spoke to PlayStation support chat, who effectively snubbed the report.</p>
	<p>He was informed that he "chose to buy it" and "should have informed himself based on the reviews and screenshots" (of which there are none that show the stolen assets in question). He was also told that he accepted the terms and conditions, and that it was only "illegal in your opinon". Following this he was kicked from the chat, and unable to take screenshots as evidence, Graslu00 has requested the chat logs which must be provided under GDPR Subject Access Request laws.</p>

	<p>Looking at the comparison images, the general layout is identical. This is no miraculous conicidence, it is blatant plagiarism and something that should be addressed by Sony. Surely if something is found to be an infringment of intellectual property, within a game allowed on their platform, they should be responsible for following up on reports. Thoroughly investigating this and dealing with it suitable fashion is the least they should be doing to protect their services.</p>
	<p>The process to get a game onto the store needs to be raised, and the tools to create them need to be out of reach of studios like iOrder SRL, because this is a totally garbage move.</p>

	<p>The N64's FOV is slightly wider than that of Agent 07's, but the fact of the matter is that the similarities within just the angle-for-angle mountain line alone are clearly the result of ripping assets from one game, and (poorly) using them in their own for monetary gain, which is not legal!</p>
	<p>Everything from the door and ladder position to the cut outs in the tower are cloned. This is not a nostalgic recreation, this is flagrant disregard for copyright laws, and at best a cash grab on the PSN store to trick people into parting with money for terrible quality, and fraudulent goods.</p>

	<p>Except for the reflection and the shadowing, the scene is a 1:1 copy of the original iconic vista. Ladder positions, number of mooring pins, and the guard towers size, shape and proportions are the same. The only thing missing is the fortified island.</p>
