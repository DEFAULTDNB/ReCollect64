	<h4>Peculiar Polygons</h4>

	<p>When I first played N64 in 1997, I remember thinking that the <i>Super Mario 64</i> version of Mario was amazing. It was the first time I had seen him in full 3D, and circling the camera around him meant you could experience the plumber in all of his 360-degree glory.</p>
	<p>In 1999 I played <i>Super Smash Bros.</i>, a game that I won't pretend to love; it's okay, but I had been an avid SNES Street Fighter II player since I had played it in the arcades and a fierce <i>Tekken 3</i> competitor (1998) on my sister's PlayStation. While SSB didn't quite cut it for me regarding playability or graphics, one thing triggered me in particular: Mario's model.</p>
	<p>How had three years passed, but Mario looked worse? The state of Mario in that game directly affected the fact that my friends and I ever played SSB. If I'm honest, there were probably 1-2 of us wanting to play SSB; the other 5 or 6, were more than happy remaining on <i>Tekken 3</i> and not giving it a second look.</p>
	<p>Today I want to examine how Nintendo portrayed Mario Mario (yes, his surname is Mario) in three dimensions, during the 64-bit era. Between 1996 and 2001, seven games featured Mario as a 3D entity, so going chronologically and skipping over any 2D entries, such as <i>Mario Kart 64, Paper Mario</i>, or <i>Mario No Photopi</i>, we will take a look at Mario's 3D Models.</p>

	<p><i>Super Mario 64</i> set the benchmark for Mario's curated look in 1996. Nintendo is extremely precious about Mario's look, and their brand guidelines dictate everything from the size of his hat the exact RGB values of his clothing, even down to the curls of his moustache.</p>
	<p>This model used just 760 triangles and a handful of textures, blended with shading, to achieve the signature look. With the exception of his stone-cold eyes, this is how Mario should have looked throughout every game he appeared in with a 3D form, though sadly this was not the case.</p>

	<p>Proceeding <i>SM64</i>, <i>Mario Party</i> and <i>Mario Golf</i> arrived on the N64 in March and September 1999. The <i>Mario Party</i> model is notably cut down from the original <i>SM64</i>version, with just 406 triangles being used to craft the main man.</p>
	<p>The assumption as to why there is such a drastic 47% reduction in detail stems from having four players on screen at any one time. The more things the N64 had on screen the slower things got, so by stripping things down to a less complex level, they saved compute cycles and kept the games running a far nicer framerates. Mario's eyes and moustache look slightly strange. Hudson Soft, who helped produce the game, got the base details down, but the proportions of his face look wrong.</p> 
	<p><i>Mario Golf</i> saw him culled down to 404 triangles, just a couple lower than the <i>Mario Party</i> model and honestly, I think it looks far more appealing. The care and attention that Camelot gave Mario to look this good, regardless of the triangle count, have paid dividends. He clearly has some subtle lighting applied that gives him a softer look and some nice shadowing. He also appears less rotund than in <i>Mario Party</i>.</p>

	<p>In the 2000s, <i>Mario Party 2</i> saw a little redesign for Mario to make him more distinguished. The issue I have with this look is that they slanted his moustache up too high, and gave him thinner, more evil-looking eyebrows. The artists have also added ear textures in favour of his work boots having any detail. The triangle count is also 406 for this model, which indicates that Hudson Soft simply recycled the old model, remade some textures, and focused more energy on making boards and minigames.</p>
	<p>The <i>Mario Tennis</i> model, also from Y2K, used 456 triangles (12% more than they used in Mario Golf). Camelot ditched the subtly shaded look of <i>Mario Golf</i>, and though they used more triangles to gain more articulation and display more detail, the model looks worse.</p>

	<p>Hudson Soft's <i>Mario Party 3</i> in 2000 also recycled the 406 triangle model they had been using since 1999. This is easily the best version they created, with the most accurate look to Mario in any of the party game series. This version also gave Mario back the soles of his shoes and used nicer lighting throughout the game to gain a softer look on character models.</p>
	<p>HAL Laboratory, Inc.'s <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> model (and the Metal Mario model) uses just 320 triangles, the lowest number of any 64-bit 3D title starring Mario. I knew my eyes hadn't deceived me, because this model uses 58% less detail than the OG SM64 model, which is even 22% less than in the <i>Mario Party</i> games. I think this model is heinous. The textures are dull and uninspired, and if there were any way to do it better, Nintendo should have!</p>
	<p>Given the refinement in developer tools and preceeding hardware knowledge between 1996 and 2000, you would have hoped that Nintendo could have pulled out all the stops and given an SM64-accurate depiction of their console's mascot. I understand why they didn't; however, I cannot help feeling that the ongoing ethos of gameplay over graphics is something that became ingrained in Nintendo during this initial period of 3D game development.</p>

	<p>My best guess is that when the game changed direction from its beta, <i>Dragon King: The Fighting Game</i>, and moved towards a cast of 12 iconic and individually styled characters, the demand on system resources in terms of the polygon count and texture memory increased exponentially. <i>Dragon King</i> appeared to use basic vertex-shaded characters with identical statures, just coloured differently to distinguish each player on-screen. This would have used very few resources in comparison to styling the characters we know and love today in the game, so compromises were made.</p>
	<p>Even today, Nintendo prioritises gameplay over everything else. People argue that Nintendo's hardware is weak, old tech compared to current generations, but <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i> demonstrates stunning visuals paired with incredible gameplay, which more than validates their ideals.</p>

	<p>The most recent iteration of Mario, on the N64 hardware, is that of Kaze Emanuar and Biobak's stunning <i>Return to Yoshi's Island</i> model.</p>
	<p>It contains 25% fewer triangles, just 575 of them, more colour depth with a brighter colour scheme, higher resolution textures (when emulated), and antialiasing. The performance boost is some 30% over that of the original mesh in-game, so the benefits are huge. Pair this with the remodelling of joints that hide any gaps or tearing, and this model is above and beyond what Nintendo managed to produce for the system back in the late 90s.</p>
	<p>It's amazing to see just how Mario has changed over the years, and not necessarily in the aesthetic direction you would have expected. Nevertheless, The Mario games, as janky or rough as they looked back then, are now iconic of the era and to be honest, with ROM hacks and modders willing to improve each and every game, now is the best time to jump back into games such as <a href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/Smash_Remix" target="_blank"></i>Smash Remix</i></a> with extended character rosters, and Kaze's upcoming Super Mariuo 64 ROM hack <a href="https://romhacking.com/hack/return-to-yoshi-s-island-demo-2" target="_blank"><i>Return to Yoshi's Island</i></a>.
