	<h4>Spyro: Enter the N64</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Following <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b235">yesterday's news that <i>Super Mario 64</i> was being ported to the PlayStation One</a>, today we have news that the 1998 PlayStation One game <i>Spyro the Dragon</i> is being ported to the Nintendo 64!</p>
	<p>Thanks to the work of decompilation efforts of ALTRO50 and The Moby Collective, <i>Spyro the Dragon</i> is now in a state where it can be ported to alternate platforms. The decompilation project began some 10 months ago and was <a href="https://x.com/SpyroUniverse/status/1883522082254057820?s=20">initially reported by Spyro Universe</a>.</p>

	<p>Spyro 64 is an old project I've had for quite some time, basically my first steps into N64 homebrew.</p>
	<p>I recently learned that a very promising and advanced decompilation project has been started by ALTRO50, so this homemade attempt at recreating Spyro on the Nintendo 64 doesn't have much purpose anymore as there's a good chance an actual port will end up coming to this good old... SIXTYYYY FOUUUR!</p></p>
	<p>I'm showing the project as it is: raw, full of missing textures, animations that are implemented but not yet tied to actions (like gliding, charging, etc.) and, ofc, a lot of bugs 😄</p>

	<p><i>Spyro the Dragon</i> was a game-changing 3D platformer for PlayStation fans. In 1998 the game received extremely high praise, with reviews averaging from the high 80s to the mid-90s! The success even led the little dragon to become the PS1 mascot equivalent of Nintendo's Super Mario.</p>
	<p>It's possible that this port may open a whole torrent of PSX game ports on the N64, which I am entirely here for. The more the merrier, especially with AAA titles like the Spyro trilogy, the Crash Bandicoot trilogy, and even the Tekken trilogy (all dependent on decompilation) being <i>possible</i> titles that might one day be playable natively on the Nintendo 64!</p>
	<p>You can read more on the subject on Frogbull's Patreon, linked below. These are exciting times, and exclusive games we never dreamed of sharing between PSX, N64 and Dreamcast are becoming a reality thanks to decompilation and preservation.</p>
