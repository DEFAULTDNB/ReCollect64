	<h4>Cartridge Collections</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With my personal collection recently hitting 383 out of 388 titles towards a full world set of cartridges, I have decided that now is the time to look into labelling up my collection to display and categorise them in a more visually pleasing way.</p>
	<p>My garage was converted from a dust-riddled spider den into a functional office/gaming pad with storage space at the end of 2023, and since then I have fitted it out with two <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/HOMCOM-Storage-Shelves-Bookcase-Adjustable/dp/B00YMDXYPO">Homcomm "CD/DVD" bookcases</a>, each able to store 1116 CDs or 528 DVDs. With a quick count, I have over 610 carts (+29 duplicates), plus 8 64DD games (+1 duplicate). This includes the coloured carts and my new Brazilian variants!</p>
	<p>Each shelf holds a maximum of 14 cartridges, and there are 72 shelves in total, plus using the top of the unit for additional space, so it should comfortably allow a maximum capacity of 1050 carts to be stored here, theoretically. With the USA, JPN and PAL sets weighing in at 737 total cartridges (388 individual titles), I should have some room to breathe even with the masses of variants I am collecting too.</p>
	<p>Each time I get a new cartridge, I clean it up, test/dump the ROM and place it in a cartridge protector box to keep it nice and clean going forward. The only issue with this system is that you cannot see exactly which game is where, so I have decided that cart spine labels stuck on the boxes are the most straightforward solution. But where can I obtain them, and will it make the collection look amazing?<p>

	<p><i>Currently, my collection is split into shelves alphabetically. The above images are from early 2024 and don't reflect my full collection yet. I'll show you those images in a big reveal, eventually.</i></p>
	</center>
	<h4>Looking for Labels</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>My first hurdle was that even though cartridge spine labels exist, most people only provide the labels for their region. Sellers in Europe sell PAL sets; American sellers do NTSC-U sets with Japanese exclusives. I wanted them all, plus spares, because my collection is overflowing in all directions.<p>
	<p>For example, I have <i>Wave Race 64</i> PAL, NTSC, JPN and HKG variants, plus the Players Choice NTSC-U and Shindou NTSC-J versions, so for that one title alone, I would need six labels. For a game such as <i>Top Gear Rally</i> it's far worse, with ASM, AUS, BRA, EUR, FRA, FRG, HOL, ITA, ITA-1, JPN, MSA, SCN, UKV and USA variants to collect.</p>
	<p>I embarked on a mission to find the best, most cohesive sets possible, only to be stumped by shipping costs. As an example, I could get <a href="https://www.snesretroboxrevival.co.uk/details/p2098319_15708814.aspx">73 game titles for £7.99</a> from one site, but that was no use. I found <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/271775372045">all 243 PAL titles for £36 + £11.63 postage,</a> but again, that's far from covering all 388 individual titles, let alone any variants. I also found <a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/765259602/n64-full-set-of-spine-labels-replacement?ls=s&ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=n64+cartridge+label&ref=sr_gallery-1-5&content_source=d7a15d2567e2153e8230e9bc9b1c4f40c61a6a7c%253A765259602&organic_search_click=1&logging_key=d7a15d2567e2153e8230e9bc9b1c4f40c61a6a7c%3A765259602">all 388 titles on Etsy for £38</a>, but it looked awfully low quality, and it was primarily American-focused, whereas my collection is Europe/UKV-centric because of my residence in England.<p>
	<p>Overall, the cost for an NTSC-U set (296), an NTSC-J set (198) and a PAL set (243), without variants, would cost upwards of £120 before shipping. A price that I immediately baulked at and deemed utterly ridiculous. There simply had to be a better way to have it all for a more reasonable price!</p>
	<p>My last hope was to try to find the templates myself and get them printed and cut. Enter <a href="https://github.com/daxAKAhackerman/n64-label-templates">daxAKAhackerman</a>, aka Samuel De Grace, an absolute legend who has collated as many N64 labels as possible into one glorious repository, fully updated and categorised with a plethora of variants already prepared. Best of all, he also supplies the templates as PSD for easy editing or crafting into more variants!</p>

	<h4>Printing Precautions</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>After manually editing the pages down into 14 full sheets to economise this operation, my next mission was to get these printed. I should note that I haven't owned a printer for over a decade. I rarely used the one I used to have, and I think I ended up giving it away at some point, possibly when I moved house. Would it be worth buying a printer plus ink and the paper to do this myself? Evaluating the costs involved versus the quality of print, I decided against it. I couldn't justify purchasing an expensive printer and ink, nor could I cheap out and buy a £40 printer with an ink subscription, so my thoughts then turned to printing these somewhere online. Checking out anywhere that could provide high-quality self-adhesive prints turned out to cost an astronomical amount per sheet. Bearing in mind that there are now 14 full sheets (down from 19 including partials) that need printing, prices ranged from £7.99 per sheet (£111.86 + shipping) to a whopping £13 (£182 + shipping).
	<p>I was running out of affordable options fast, so my last option was to try <a href="https://www.vistaprint.co.uk/">Vistaprint</a>, a place that I had used on occasion, and I noticed that self-adhesive wall posters would cost from just £3.98 per sheet. Uploading an image and setting up the sizes, I discovered that custom sizes were actually £7.49 per sheet, and these weren't on a white background, nor were they pre-cut either. So I went back to the drawing board one last time.</p>
	<p>Floor signs are sticky, right? Yes, they are! They're hard-wearing, white-backed, self-adhesive, and crucially, The cheapest place I could find. Starting at just £4.29 per sheet, my first test sheet cost £5.29 + £4.99 postage. Had I ordered the lot it would have been £5.29 x 14 sheets + free shipping, which equals £74.06 in total laid out in my custom size. I would still have to cut them out individually, but that's ok; I'm a dab hand with a metal ruler and a scalpel.</p>
	<p>On the 10th of May I made the order for one test sheet; I'm not completely insane; I won't be doing a print run of all 14 sheets until I know that this works, but I have my fingers crossed that this could be an incredible solution for myself and others in a similar position. Imagine over 800 labels for under £80, delivered to your door, with the therapeutic and satisfying task of cutting and sticking them to your carts or cart boxes ahead of you.</p>
	<p>I will update this article further and with more intricate details depending on how well these come out. Everything could go tits up, or this could be the best "life hack" I've ever devised, so keep your eyes peeled for an update around the end of May!</p>
	<div class="info">
		<p><strong>UPDATE 1: 15/05/2025</strong> - The printed sheet arrived early. It was predicted to arrive by the 27th of May.</p>
	</div>
	<h4>Update 1: Test Print</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<center>
		<a title="" href="" onclick="window.open('Blog/Features/2025/CartLabels/CL4.JPG','targetWindow', 'toolbar=no, location=no, status=no, menubar=no, scrollbars=no, resizable=no, width=600px, Height=450px, top=150px left=350px'); return false;"><img class="thumbnail" src="Blog/Features/2025/CartLabels/CL4.JPG" width="40%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
	</center>	
	<p>Having finally received the test sheet, I could size it up and see what I was working with. First impressions are that it's hardwearing and the print quality is pretty decent overall. Keeping within the safe zone and bleed edge of the template, there is a big white area around the outer edge of the print. I was concerned that the scale would be thrown off because of this overzeaolous safety zone.</p>
	<p>The measurements of the sheets are 216mm x 280mm (portrait). Each page holds exactly 60 labels with dimensions of 62mm by 13mm. These work out a tad bit smaller than traditional cart labels that are 63mm x 16mm, but that's not an issue!</p>
	<p>The protective boxes I store my carts in measure 19mm x 77mm for each end, and 19mm x 117mm for the top and bottom panels. My plan is to put the cartridge labels on the box ends, rather than on the carts or the box tops, so that they can be easily visible on my shelving without needing to turn the lot precariously on end.</p>
	<p>I began cutting out the sheet by taking the bleed edge white margin off, and I tested the self-adhesion with an offcut from that. The verdict is that the stickiness doesn't seem all that until you put it onto the plastic box, whereby it becomes extremely stuck, which is a good thing, but it's able to be removed and respositioned with ease, and without leaving any residue or causing any damage.</p>
	<p>Cutting the entire 60 labels out with a metal ruler and craft knife took around 30 minutes because I was being najorly OCD with the perfection of the lines, and re-trimming any that had even a smidge of the neighbouring label's colouring on the edge. The way they print, they have a black border per label, but it's difficult to judge when the backing colour is black or extremely dark grey/brown/blue.</p>

	<p>Overall I would say that this test print was is a resounding success. The next step is to order the proceeding batch of 13 sheets with the exact same specifications according to the template initially used. I will also upload exact details of dimensions and specifications here when I make my next update to this article!</p>
