	<h4>Cartridge Collections</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With my personal collection recently hitting 383 out of 388 titles towards a full world set of cartridges, I have decided that now is the time to look into labelling up my collection to display and categorise them in a more visually pleasing way.</p>
	<p>My garage was converted from a dust-riddled spider den into a functional office/gaming pad with storage space at the end of 2023, and since then I have fitted it out with two <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/HOMCOM-Storage-Shelves-Bookcase-Adjustable/dp/B00YMDXYPO">Homcomm "CD/DVD" bookcases</a>, each able to store 1116 CDs or 528 DVDs. With a quick count, I have over 610 carts (+29 duplicates), plus 8 64DD games (+1 duplicate). This includes the coloured carts and my new Brazilian variants!</p>
	<p>Each shelf holds a maximum of 14 cartridges, and there are 72 shelves in total, plus using the top of the unit for additional space, so it should comfortably allow a maximum capacity of 1050 carts to be stored here, theoretically. With the USA, JPN and PAL sets weighing in at 737 total cartridges (388 individual titles), I should have some room to breathe even with the masses of variants I am collecting too.</p>
	<p>Each time I get a new cartridge, I clean it up, test/dump the ROM and place it in a cartridge protector box to keep it nice and clean going forward. The only issue with this system is that you cannot see exactly which game is where, so I have decided that cart spine labels stuck on the boxes are the most straightforward solution. But where can I obtain them, and will it make the collection look amazing?<p>

	<h4>Looking for Labels</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>My first hurdle was that even though cartridge spine labels exist, most people only provide the labels for their region. Sellers in Europe sell PAL sets; American sellers do NTSC-U sets with Japanese exclusives. I wanted them all, plus spares, because my collection is overflowing in all directions.<p>
	<p>For example, I have <i>Wave Race 64</i> PAL, NTSC, JPN and HKG variants, plus the Players Choice NTSC-U and Shindou NTSC-J versions, so for that one title alone, I would need six labels. For a game such as <i>Top Gear Rally</i> it's far worse, with ASM, AUS, BRA, EUR, FRA, FRG, HOL, ITA, ITA-1, JPN, MSA, SCN, UKV and USA variants to collect.</p>
	<p>I embarked on a mission to find the best, most cohesive sets possible, only to be stumped by shipping costs. As an example, I could get <a href="https://www.snesretroboxrevival.co.uk/details/p2098319_15708814.aspx">73 game titles for £7.99</a> from one site, but that was no use. I found <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/271775372045">all 243 PAL titles for £36 + £11.63 postage,</a> but again, that's far from covering all 388 individual titles, let alone any variants. I also found <a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/765259602/n64-full-set-of-spine-labels-replacement?ls=s&ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=n64+cartridge+label&ref=sr_gallery-1-5&content_source=d7a15d2567e2153e8230e9bc9b1c4f40c61a6a7c%253A765259602&organic_search_click=1&logging_key=d7a15d2567e2153e8230e9bc9b1c4f40c61a6a7c%3A765259602">all 388 titles on Etsy for £38</a>, but it looked awfully low quality, and it was primarily American-focused, whereas my collection is Europe/UKV-centric because of my residence in England.<p>
	<p>Overall, the cost for an NTSC-U set (296), an NTSC-J set (198) and a PAL set (243), without variants, would cost upwards of £120 before shipping. A price that I immediately baulked at and deemed utterly ridiculous. There simply had to be a better way to have it all for a more reasonable price!</p>
	<p>My last hope was to try to find the templates myself and get them printed and cut. Enter <a href="https://github.com/daxAKAhackerman/n64-label-templates">daxAKAhackerman</a>, aka Samuel De Grace, an absolute legend who has collated as many N64 labels as possible into one glorious repository, fully updated and categorised with a plethora of variants already prepared. Best of all, he also supplies the templates as PSD for easy editing or crafting into more variants!</p>

	<h4>Printing Precautions</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>After manually editing the pages down into 14 full sheets to economise this operation, my next mission was to get these printed. I should note that I haven't owned a printer for over a decade. I rarely used the one I used to have, and I think I ended up giving it away at some point, possibly when I moved house. Would it be worth buying a printer plus ink and the paper to do this myself? Evaluating the costs involved versus the quality of print, I decided against it. I couldn't justify purchasing an expensive printer and ink, nor could I cheap out and buy a £40 printer with an ink subscription, so my thoughts then turned to printing these somewhere online. Checking out anywhere that could provide high-quality self-adhesive prints turned out to cost an astronomical amount per sheet. Bearing in mind that there are now 14 full sheets (down from 19 including partials) that need printing, prices ranged from £7.99 per sheet (£111.86 + shipping) to a whopping £13 (£182 + shipping).
	<p>I was running out of affordable options fast, so my last option was to try <a href="https://www.vistaprint.co.uk/">Vistaprint</a>, a place that I had used on occasion, and I noticed that self-adhesive wall posters would cost from just £3.98 per sheet. Uploading an image and setting up the sizes, I discovered that custom sizes were actually £7.49 per sheet, and these weren't on a white background, nor were they pre-cut either. So I went back to the drawing board one last time.</p>
	<p>Floor signs are sticky, right? Yes, they are! They're hard-wearing, white-backed, self-adhesive, and crucially, just £4.49 per sheet (£62.86 + £4.99 shipping for 14) when laid out in my custom size! I would still have to cut them out individually, but that's ok; I'm a dab hand with a metal ruler and a scalpel.</p>
	<p>The order has been made for one test sheet; I'm not completely insane; I won't be doing a print run of all 14 sheets until I know that this works, but I have my fingers crossed that this could be an incredible solution for myself and others in a similar position. Imagine over 800 labels for just £67.85, delivered to your door, with the therapeutic and satisfying task of cutting and sticking them to your carts or cart boxes ahead of you.</p>
	<p>I will update this article further and with more intricate details depending on how well these come out. Everything could go tits up, or this could be the best "life hack" I've ever devised, so keep your eyes peeled for an update around the end of May!</p>
