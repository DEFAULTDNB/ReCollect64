	<h4>Tonic Trouble</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Ubisoft were premuim 3D platform game designers in the late 90s, though nowadays they tend to focus on 2D platforming. <i>Tonic Trouble</i> was originally developed as a test for the engine that powered <i>Rayman 2</i> and was released after heavy delays in August of 1999.</p>
	<p><i>Rayman 2: The Great Escape</i> was highly regarded on all platforms, and released just two months later in October 1999. The quality difference between the two games meant that Rayman scored an incredible 90% average score, whereas <i>Tonic Trouble</i> scored just 72% on average. The latter is often overlooked as a game, but it's actually not terrible!</p>
