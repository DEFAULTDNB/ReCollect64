	<h4>Compatibility Correction</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With the release of the Analogue 3D FPGA N64 console, a lot of people were left miffed that their favourite flashcarts, the EverDrive 64 X5 and X7, were not supported. Krikzz has today released an update to the ED OS <b>(V3.09)</b> and the bootloader that rectifies this issue and lets you use your flashcarts on your brand spanking new hardware!</p>
	<div class="container">
	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>I just got my A3D test sample and made compatibility fixes for it. Here are the installation instructions:</p>
	<p>1. Download and Install OS-V3.09 <a href="https://krikzz.com/pub/support/everdrive-64/x-series/OS/OS-V3.09.zip">DOWNLOAD HERE</a>.</p>
	<p>2. Download bootrom-v5.xx.b64 and copy in to any place on SD card. <a href="https://krikzz.com/pub/support/everdrive-64/x-series/bootloader/bootrom-v5.04.b64">DOWNLOAD HERE</a>.</p>
	<p>3. Run the cartridge on an original N64 console (it will not start on Analogue 3D with an older bootloader).</p>
	<p>4. In the cartridge menu, select the bootrom-v5.xx.b64 and press [A]</p>
	<p>5. When the installer screen opens, click [START] to begin the installation.</p>
	<p>OS-V3.09 includes bootloader installer and some stability fixes for A3D as well.</p>
	<p>All future orders from krikzz.com will be shipped with new bootloader preinstalled.</p>
	<p>There is no option to install bootloader without original N64, because you simply can't boot cart on A3D with old bootloader. The only solution in this case install 1K pulldown resistor at cartridge pin AD7, with this fix A3D will boot ED64-X even with old bootloader.</p>
	<p>As for ED64 V2X/V3 it seems like it already works fine with OS 2.13. I don't have V3 at the moment, but my v2.5 works just fine with OS 2.13	</p>

	<p>I can confirm that this is working on my X7, and I can now enjoy my EverDrive on my A3D (firmware 1.1.0), as well as my SummerCart64!</p>
