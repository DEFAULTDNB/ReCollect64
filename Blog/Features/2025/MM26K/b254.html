	<p>Two days ago, the Goldin Auctions, a major collectables marketplace, finalised one of the most incredible sales to have ever graced the Nintendo 64 collecting scene. A PSA 10 graded copy of <i>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</i> finished its listing for a whopping $26,922!</p>
	<p>The listing was titled as "2000 N64 Nintendo 64 The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask (USA) Sealed Video Game - Made in Japan, Collector's Edition - PSA 10 Sealed A++/Gold Label - Pop 1, Highest Graded Across All Variants". This is one of the most incredible finds to be listed since the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b40">sealed 9.4 graded, and much rarer, copy of <i>Clay Fighter: Sculptor's Cut</i> was found and sold at the end of 2024</a>, which sold for a gargantuan $44k.</p>

	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The auction, which attracted just 20 bids in total, began at just $5,000 on November the 17th and crept up to $10,000 on the 6th of December, finally jumping to $20,000+ by the 7th of December.</p>
	<p>The full description, below, goes on to say how, of the 280 copies that have ever been graded and sold, none has ever achieved the top "10" rating until now. Any PSA rating is determined by the condition, tampering, creasing, fading, "dings" and seal integrity. To score a perfect 10 is almost unheard of.</p>

	<p>Graded 10 Sealed with a V-seam rating of A++ Gold Label by PSA (603856-005). Not only is this copy of the 2000 Nintendo 64 masterpiece The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask the highest graded in its tier (Made in Japan, Collector’s Edition), it is also the highest graded example out of the 280 recorded in PSA’s census reporting, and its superlative grade is shared with no other copy. Goldin is proud to offer this copy of Majora’s Mask, as it is not only immaculately preserved—with an impeccable A++ seal rating and an overall grade of 10—but also the very first Gold Label we’ve offered at auction.</p>
	<p>Majora’s Mask, released in North America on October 26, 2000, is a direct sequel to the 1998 masterpiece Ocarina of Time. Produced by Shigeru Miyamoto, directed by Eiji Aonuma and Yoshiaki Koizumi, and scored by the legendary Koji Kondo, it features graphical enhancements that build upon Ocarina to create a darker narrative tone filled with emotional depth. Though it sold roughly half as many copies as its predecessor (approximately 3.36 million), it has become a cult classic—essential to the overall Zelda experience.</p>
	<p>Considering this copy is 25 years old, it has survived in near-perfect form, making it the ultimate example of this title to come to market and an essential cornerstone of any Zelda video game collection.</p>
