	<h4>Doing it Yourself</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Console modder and Nintendo 64 enthusiast, <a href="https://x.com/Downing1082">Downing's Basement</a>, has recently shared on Twitter/X.com that their latest project has now been made public:</p>

	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>After an AMAZING reveal at the #midwestgamingclassic, I can finally let the rest of the world know what I've been working on for the past year!</p>
	<p>Kickstarter hopefully coming in a few weeks with a target ship month of June 2025! More info soon!</p>

	<p>Having built portable N64s as commissions previously, Downing's Basement has designed a DIY kit (the opposite of a consoliser, a portabliser!), allowing anyone with a little console modification acumen to have a go at building their own at home based on the "5th GeN64" design and with the help of a handy 70 step online assembly guide.</p>
	<p>Navigating over to DowningsBasement.com, his pages state that the kit will include everything except the motherboard and basic tools and consumables:</p>

	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>This kit is the culmination of nearly 16 years of console modding experience.</p>
	<p>With this particular project starting as a new, from-the-ground-up portable commission over two years ago, I knew I had something different as the final pieces came together. And this of course was the spark that re-ignited a passion project of mine that has successfully evaded me for well over a decade.</p>
	<p>For the past year now, I’ve been in the works of refining and tweaking the design of my latest N64 Portable series, “The 5thGeN64”, into a comprehensive Do-It-Yourself Kit!
	<p>And with the help of GMANMODZ and AURELIO of 4 Layer Tech, I believe that this is the most modern and user friendly N64 mod to hit the market.</p>
	<p><b>The kit includes everything from custom PCBs for all the very complicated components, to a 3D printed enclosure with laminated vinyl graphics and all the screws and clips needed to put it together. With a few exceptions…</b></p>

	<h4>Portable Passion</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Downing's Basement has been "making it portable since 2009" and as such, has made countless handheld homages. To date, he has built 21 bespoke portable N64s for customers and has been constantly evolving his skills and techniques to bring the product up to an incredible specification.</p>
	<p>Prebuilt standard unit specs:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>5″ 4:3 Aspect Ratio 640×480 Composite LCD Display
		<li>3D Printed Enclosure w/CNC Acrylic/Polycarbonate or PET Screen Protector and Self-Adhesive Art Work
		<li>3D Printed Buttons & Joy Con control stick
		<li>Custom Main PCB & Modular Components for Audio, Controller and Power Management by “4 Layer Tech”
		<li>USB-C PD Charging
		<li>(3)18650 Batteries for about 2hrs Battery Life
		<li>Supports Play & Charge over USB-C PD power adapter
		<li>3mm (1/8″) Headphone Stereo Jack w/auto switching
		<li>EXTRAS INCLUDED – USB-C Charging Dock with Magnetic Disconnect, 45W USB-C PD Charger, 6′ USB-C Charging Cable, Apache 2800 Carrying Case
	</ul>

	<p>Though prebuilt systems currently retail for $1200 USD (including insured shipping, tariffs and taxes paid, 25+ hours of labour and over $300 worth of components), the kits will certainly go a long way towards hobbyists and enthusiasts building theirs with their own sourced hardware for more pocket-friendly prices.</p>
	<p>Sadly, these systems are strictly single-player, cannot be connected to a TV, and do not support any expansion pak games. The last point is a bit of a bummer, but considering the form factor, it's not surprising. Downing's Basement also states that "The Expansion Pak could be installed, but it kills the battery life and increases the amount of heat distributed through the system, which are two instances portables actively try to avoid and is not recommended!" which is honest and fair to point out!</p> 
	<p>The kits should be priced around the $350 mark if the Kickstarter fails and a more appealing $250 should it gain the backing required and prove successful. Further details can be found on the dedicated <a href="https://downingsbasement.com/5thgen64/">5th GeN64 Kits page</a>.</p>
