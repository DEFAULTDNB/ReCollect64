	<h4>Micro$hit</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When Microsoft acquired Rare in September 2002, we all hoped for the best for the studio that shaped our childhoods and crossed our fingers that they would continue to produce sequels to the 64-bit games we loved.</p>
	<p>Today, following the end of their fiscal year, Microsoft have done the unthinkable, making 9000 people, roughly 4% of their workforce, jobless from several departments, including their Xbox division and studio The Initiative, headed by Darrell Gallagher.</p>
	<p>After their rather public acknowledgement of having very little desire to ship hardware anymore (with founding team members stating "Xbox hardware is dead"), the news that they're effectively cancelling the current development of <i>Perfect Dark</i> as well as titles Rare had in development, such as Everwild, is shocking.</p>
	<p>Microsoft started up The Initiative in 2018, with the creative minds of Crystal Dynamics joining Gallagher in 2021, spearheading the revival of the Y2K fem-fatale action-adventure stealth-em-up. Today's closure of the studio means that The Initiative never managed to release a single game in their 7 year lifespan, and <i>Perfect Dark</i> will not get to see the light of day as a direct result.</p>
	<p>Even without Rare directly at the helm of Joanna's next entry, we were pretty enthused to see how the latest incarnation would look and play through the few crumbs we have been fed since progress shifted in 2021 from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5.</p>
	<p>Rumours circulating regarding a possible new <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> title have also been curtailed for now, as Gregg Mayles leaves Rare following the cancellations, plus there was currently no known active development made towards that IP as yet.</p>
	<p>I cannot help but feel for the people who have sadly lost their jobs today, and I truly believe that what made Rare so magnificent during the golden Nintendo 64 era has been stubbed out since Xbox bought them.</p>
