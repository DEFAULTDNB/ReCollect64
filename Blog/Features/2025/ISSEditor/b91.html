	<h4>On the Ball</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>In January, Nicola Cusano and Pedro Seidel on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/InternationalSuperstarSoccer2000/" target="_blank">International Superstar Soccer Fans (Nintendo 64) Facebook group</a> released their <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b76" target="_blank">editor for <i>ISS 2000</i></a>.</p>
	<p>This time, they have started building an editor for <i>ISS98</i>, which aims to include the same functionality as their last project but for the pre-Y2K edition of Konami's incredibly popular football simulation series.</p>
	<p>Similarly, this version auto-detects the ROMs region and can automatically input all the players real names from an included pre-built database. Though it recognises the NTSC-J ROM, it does not yet work with <i>Jikkyou World Soccer - World Cup France '98 (Japan).z64</i>.</p>

	<h4>ROM Revisions</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Microsoft.NETCore.App version 8.0.0 or higher is required to run any version of the ISS editor, but this version does not support visual editing of player's faces yet; you can only flip through the options numerically. The editor also automatically patches your existing ROM, so please do not forget to make a backup of the untouched ROM before you start editing anything.</p>
	<p>Compatible ROMs:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>International Superstar Soccer '98 (USA).z64
		<li>International Superstar Soccer '98 (Europe).z64
		<li>Jikkyou World Soccer - World Cup France '98 (Japan).z64 (Not supported yet)
	</ul>
	<p>With this project in its infancy, the editor is a little bit more limited than the version for <i>ISS2000</i>, with no ability to edit formations or player's physical looks just yet. These features will come when more offsets and byte codes are discovered. They are not entirely portable between ROMs, and most differ from game to game.</p>
	<p>I have no doubts that the team will combine their efforts and build a one-for-all solution for editing any International Superstar Soccer title for the N64 in the not-so-distant future.</p>

	<p><b>#### ISS98 v0.63 Release #### 02/03/2025</b></p>
	<p>Fix on fly:</p>
	<p>-Fixed problem with CRC saving and Edit Formation</p>
	<p><b>#### ISS98 v0.61 Release #### 02/03/2025</b></p>
	<p>What's new and fix:</p>
	<p>-Fixed some Real Names wrong</p>
	<p>-Fixed Real Names import bug with All stars team. Now automatically refresh with real names.</p>
	<p>-Fixed a lot of bugs.</p>
	<p>A lot of new features:</p>
	<p>-Added the "Transfer" button to move players. Finally, we can fix Ireland lineup</p>
	<p>-Each ROM, in its final section, contains empty parts that do not affect its functionality. I used this space to create new players, who will then be transferable to the game's teams. This way, we can create usable reserves.</p>
	<p>-Implemented import/export functions for players.</p>
	<p>-Added photos for each player present in every version, plus some test photos. If you wish, you can place images in the "photos" folder, which will be loaded into the editor. The image name is determined by the three appearance parameters. For example, for Ronaldo 61-F-B8, the name will be 610FB8.jpg</p>
	<p>-Added "COPY/PASTE" buttons to copy appearance between players.</p>
	<p>-Introduced STADIUM selection. Now, it is possible to set a different stadium for each team. In the tests performed, no problems were found in the International Cup and World League modes. The team will use the specified stadium.</p>
	<p><b>IMPORTANT: MODIFYING THE STADIUM AFFECTS MEMPAK USAGE. On RMG, simply set "Settings" -> "Core" -> "Save filename format" -> "Internal ROM name" to use the Mempak without issues, if you don't edit ROM name, obviously. If you edit ROM name remember to rename MPK file at the same. I don't use other emulators, so I can't provide instructions for those. Personally, I use savestates, also because any name modification would need to be reset in the game's internal editor. For All Stars Teams, there is the code, so the Mempak is, for me, not necessary.</b></p>
	<p>To avoid this workaround you must don't edit Stadium.</p>
	<p><b>IMPORTANT 2: This version is in beta. Always make backups.</b></p>
	<p><b>### BETA 0.52-1 Changelog ### 25/02/2025</b></p>
	<p>What's new and fixed:<p>
	<p>Fix the Real Names automatic loader: accent removed from Japanese versions, special thanks to Anderson Maia to report. Fixed two Gonzalez from Chile (swapped by Konami), special thanks to Tristiano Ronaldo who found the issued.
	<p><b>NEW FEATURES:</b></p>
	<p>Formation editing: we can edit now all team formations and preset formations.</p>
	<p>New app icon.</p>
	<p>Fixed numeric control with right value limit.</p>
	<p>Probabily last skill on Special Skills 1 list is Malicia (Gamesmanship in PES, Penalty Magnet in ISS 2000). For now I left the ? because I'm not totally sure.</p>
