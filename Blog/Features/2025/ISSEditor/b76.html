	<h4>Football Fanatics</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>A couple of months ago I contacted Nicola Cusano and Pedro Seidel over at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/InternationalSuperstarSoccer2000/" target="_blank">International Superstar Soccer Fans (Nintendo 64) Facebook group</a> regarding work on an editor they have been working on for <i>ISS 2000</i>. Now, they have updated the editor to version <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/InternationalSuperstarSoccer2000/permalink/4123135414587243/" target="_blank">0.61b</a>, a small bug fix for 0.60b, which was released in December.</p> 
	<p>This wonderfully intuitive editor can easily modify a staggering number of options, including formations, tactics, and even your character's various skill attributes, temperament, ability in adverse weather conditions, balance, footwork, faces, hair colour, shirt number, name, shoes, and much more besides!</p>

	<p><b>### LATEST BETA 0.7.5 Changelog ### 14/03/2025</b></p>
	<p>Thanks to <b>Tristiano Ronaldo (Mr. NBA)</b> for his precious help, effort, beta testing and bug reporting.</p>
	<p>Formation: like the other editors now you can edit every team formation. Even the preset formation.</p>
	<p>Discovered almost every player attribute. Why Konami hidden these values?</p>
	<p>Captains: the game doesn't have real captains like in the '98 or 2000 versions. But now, you can choose the player who will appear in the coin toss.</p>
	<p>Some little graphics improvement.</p>
	<p><b>Only for Japan edition:</b></p>
	<p>Now you can read and edit Katakana Alphabet.</p>
	<p>Button helper to write in Katakana.</p>
	<p><b>### Release BETA 0.61-1 Changelog ### 15/02/2025</b></p>
	<p>You can modify:<p>
	<p>Every player's ability including their appearance. Some data is unknown to me and I didn't stay on that too deep, the same values are also in the ISS98 version, if I discover anything when I do that version I'll update this one too. I've left some small notes on ToolTip. In this version, the modification of in-game appearance and photo is distinguished. I haven't mapped all cases, but I've seen that the skin color corresponds, so I've left only one active control that modifies both. For all other appearance modifications, try and see the results.üòÅ</p>
	<p>As already indicated in previous posts, some abilities are hidden in game. The usual 2 GK Skills, Offense and Defense Rate. These last two are managed in a strange way. Goalkeepers have very high values and some teams have lower values, apparently without reason. I've also added these values in the calculation of the average Overall via button.</p>
	<p>The name editing in the game doesn't have a default function to center names. Added a button to do it automatically.</p>
	<p>At the bottom, there's the modification for the OVERALL of each team, including the All Stars Teams. You can also modify the free kick takers of the same. Also the ROM name.</p>
	<p>On the right, you can also modify the All Stars Teams. In this version (and I think also in '98), unlike the 2000 version, they are not composed of their own players but of pointers that "search" for the corresponding player. Each selection list will be composed of all players in such a way that you can select them comfortably.</p>
	<p>Known issues:</p>
	<p>Every time you modify the ROM, the mempak stops working due to the CRC. For now, I haven't looked at how to recalculate it in the mempak as well. I might add it later.</p>
	<p>Due to the CRC calculation, Windows and some antivirus might tell you that a virus is present. This is absolutely not the case. The problem is that nowadays PC "defenders" automatically block files if they see words that they consider "bad" (like CRC, Editor).</p>
	<p><b>### Release BETA 0.61 Changelog ### 20/01/2025</b></p>
	<p>Fixed Weak Foot Ability for right foot.</p>
	<p>Little bug fixed</p>
	<p><b>### Release BETA 0.6 Changelog ### 22/12/2024</b></p>
	<p>Fixed bug on value editing. In some circumstances the editor reloaded the old values.</p>
	<p>Fixed Yes-No-Cancel and a problem on change player/team selection. Now every button do the right things. Even if you change team.</p>
	<p>Fixed Update of Set Piecer selection after editing. I forgot to do before first release.</p>
	<p>Fixed a bug in Formation that didn't apply the correct color when changing the dot. Refactoring on certain rules and preloaded formation.</p>
	<p>Re-added ROM name editing under the Text tab.</p>
	<p>Full physical appareance editing!</p>
	<p>You need to use a bit of "imagination" to understand the pairing, because I have only mapped one case (white skin/white hair). It would be impossible to map them all, as there are more than 200,000 images (400000 if consider J-League...)! They would also be unmanageable.</p>
	<p>For the JPN version, there will still be some waiting. There are many difference compared to the International version regarding pictures, shoes and physical appearance. I'll have to start over with Cheat Engine!</p>
	<p>I take this opportunity to wish you all happy holidays, I'm stopping for now with editing! Holidays!</p>

	<p>Using the editor, Nicola and Pedro have also painstakingly updated <i>International Superstar Soccer 2000</i> into "REAL International Superstar Soccer 2000 (USA) (En,Es) (Rev 1) v0.28" (at the time of writing) to feature real names, updated rosters, and 29 teams from the following places: EURO 2000 - All 16 Teams, Euro Qualification - Croatia, Ukraine, Russia, Copa America 1999 - Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Uruguay, African Nations Cup 2000 - Cameroon, Nigeria, Confederations Cup 1999 - U.S.A., Mexico, Asian Nation Cup 2000 - Japan, Oceania Nation Cup 2000 - Australia. They have also crafted "ISS 2022", which features massively updated rosters and groups (63 in total), including Oceania: Australia, Fiji, Asia B: Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Qatar, Asia A: Japan, S.Korea, China, Concacaf: U.S.A., Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, South America: Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Uruguay, Paraguay   Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Ecuador, Africa: Cameroon, Nigeria, S.Africa, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Liberia (Senegal), Algeria, Mali, Ghana, Europe A: Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Holland, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark , Belgium, Portugal, Luxembourg, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Europe B: England, Scotland, Wales, N.Ireland, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Europe C: Yugoslavia, Croatia, Greece, Poland, Czech Rep., Slovakia, Macedonia, Europe D: Russia, Turkey, Ukraine.</p>
	<p>Each version of the editor adds more features and tweaks to make the process easier and more granular. Just take a look at the level of detail the guys have gone to to build this incredible toolset:</p>
	<div class="container">
	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i>
	<p>The famous byte 11 has been decrypted.</p>
	<p>In ISS 2000, I can confirm that it does not serve any purpose, or rather, it would probably have been useful if they had acquired the licenses for the players. Here's how.</p>
	<p>Byte 11 is used with byte 12 (which we know is also the jersey number byte). In the J-League version, they identify (together with byte 21, which relates to the photos) the pointer to the player's photo. I give you an example to explain how it works.</p>
	<p>The first player of the first team has values 00 and 85 (55 in hexadecimal). Consider that the section reserved for the jersey number consists of 64 values, ranging from 0 to 63, although visually, the game only allows us to use numbers from 1 to 40 (+ for 0).</p>
	<p>Therefore, for the jersey number, only the remainder of byte 12 is considered, specifically 85 mod 64. The first player actually has jersey number 21.</p>
	<p>The rest is managed entirely for the player's photo. Thus, byte 11 is 00, and byte 12 should be considered as the integer division of 85 by 64, which results in 1.</p>
	<p>The first pointer is 00 1X.</p>
	<p>Examples:</p>
	<p>1. Player 00 85 -> 00 (85/64 integer = 1) (85 mod 64 = 21) -> Photo pointer 00 1X - Jersey number 21</p>
	<p>2. Player 00 130 -> 00 (130/64 integer = 2) (130 mod 64 = 2) -> Photo pointer 00 2X - Jersey number 2</p>
	<p>3. Player 00 195 -> 00 (195/64 integer = 3) (195 mod 64 = 3) -> Photo pointer 00 3X - Jersey number 3</p>
	<p>4. Player 01 04 -> 01 (4/64 integer = 0) (4 mod 64 = 4) -> Photo pointer 01 0X - Jersey number 4</p>
	<p>and so on.</p>
	<p>For this functionality, byte 21 must be set to 79; otherwise, it will use the classic photos we know from ISS 2000.</p>
	<p>This feature will slightly delay the release of the editor. In fact, a version will be released very soon, but it will not yet include the J-League version.</p>

	<h4>Tactical Tweaking</h4>

	<p>Microsoft.NETCore.App version 8.0.0 or higher is required to run the editor, but once you have it up and running, you can open your ROM and get editing everything, including formations, tactics, and scenarios. The editor also automatically creates a backup (*.bak) of your ROM, should you make any changes you wish to revert to the stock settings.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>International Superstar Soccer 2000 (Europe) (En, De).z64

	<p>Once you have your ROM tweaks in place, simply go to the TEXT option and name your ROM according to your changes; for example, every group and player could be edited to form the teams from the 1986 World Cup, with all their traits. Yeah, that was the one where Diego Maradona *cough* cheated *cough* (so set his handballing skills to the max) and then you could name the file "ISS2K: Mexico 86 Edition", and export the modded ROM, ready to play!</p>
	<p>Notably, the Japanese equivalent of the game has not been granted compatibility yet, but it's only a matter of time, as Nicola and Pedro are making strides with each revision, so please check out the group if you want to follow their progress!</p>
