	<h4>PlayStation Platforming</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Who would have thought that this year, a late 90's Nintendo 64-based platformer that's now owned by Microsoft would be coming (unofficially) to PlayStation?</p>
	<p>Last November I noted that <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b52">Banjo & Kazooie had been spotted in Trip's Voyage</a>, a gorgeously nostalgic game that's been entirely designed and constructed within PlayStation's <i>Dreams</i>, Media Molecule's console-based game creation system, by Eupholace and Piece_of_Craft.</p>
	<p>Today, one year on, the duo have now set a release date and given their game a title, <i>Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania</i>! Check out the trailer here:</p>

	<h4>Classic Capers</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With the main premise being to get Mumbo his body back, the furry feathered duo must adventure around the environments, solving clues and progressing the story beats in order to complete their latest life-saving mission.</p>
	<p>The game appears to be set on an intriguing desert island, packed with a castle fortress and pirate's galleon to explore, collecting notes, Jinjos and jiggies from various nooks and crannies of the map, and avoiding danger by way of some freshly designed enemies. You can even see a character similar to <i>Donkey Kong Country</i>'s Squawks the Parrot, flying around with a juicy golden puzzle piece in his beak.</p>
	<p><a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#c25">Eupholace</a> has stated that updates will be provided in the lead-up to the 3rd of December release, so keep your eyes peeled for more nostalgic collect-a-thon goodness in the following weeks!</p>
