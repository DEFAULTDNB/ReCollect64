	<h4>Big Head Mode</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>This week, Nike officially unveiled their Low Poly Nike Air Max 1s and a special edition which is a nostalgic mash-up of Nikes signature sneakers and the 1998 N64 classic, <i>GoldenEye 007</i>.</p>
	<p>Also known as "Big Head Mode", the crossover trainer borrows several iconic features of the N64 game to give it a truly unique look. The colourway is a mixture of grey and white pixelated textures, black accents across the upper, soles reminiscent of the grey cartridge and "gold"-hued laces and motifs. On the inside of the tongue is an ESRB rating of "E for Everyone", the Nike Swoosh itself is "low poly" and the rear aspect features the unmistakably legendary health bars encapsulating the Nike Air text.</p>
	<p>As a connoisseur of Nike trainers since the 90s, I'm a big fan of this look. My previous trainers were the Nike Air Max 90s with a Nintendo Switch-looking red and blue colouration, and my current pair are the sleeker <a href="https://www.nike.com/gb/t/free-metcon-6-workout-shoes-zt7gPZ">Metcon 6s</a>. I think these Air Max 1s are gorgeous, and if I had the money to spare right now, I probably would get a couple of pairs: one to rock and one to stock!</p>

	<h4>Sneeky Sneakers</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>GoldenEye 007 is one of those games that everyone looks back fondly on. Whether it be for the shot-for-shot close-knit nature of the game to the film or the memories carved into your grey matter thanks to the countless hours spent with friends pummelling each other in the heat of battle, the game is an enduring symbol of a thoroughly incredible era of gaming that raised the bar and that will never be forgotten.</p>
	<p>A pair of Nike Air Max 1 Low Poly 'Big Head Mode' will set you back £145 and will be available to bag from tomorrow, April the 7th, 2025, if you preordered. If not, you may have to wait a couple of months before they appear for general sale on the <a href="https://www.nike.com/gb/snkrs-app">SNKRS</a> app.</p>
	<p>Standard coloured Low Poly's will cost you £135, but if you're an N64 fiend like me, you might just want to stump up the extra tenner for that extra bump of nostalgia!</p>
