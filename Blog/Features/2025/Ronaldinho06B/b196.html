	<h4>World Class Hack</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Back in April, Chris Jaroki uploaded his updated modification of the legendary Brazilian bootleg, <i>Ronaldinho Soccer 64</i>. The update includes all of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, or Copa de Mundo '06, teams, players and stats (100% tweaked for Rev B), as well as updated Portuguese commentary!</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, back in April, I could not test or write about the initial release because the link was dead; however, in the last 24 hours, the link to the BSP patch has been updated, and now the Mundial Ronaldinho Soccer 64 (PES 6) (Rev B) total transformation ROM hack stands proudly in its place.</p>

	<h4>Patching Practice</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>If you would like to try the ROM hack out for yourself, all you need is the "International Superstar Soccer 64 (USA).z64" ROM, with an MD5 of 6A345402AE1DB5CE1041365E36126BCE, and the supplied BPS patch found over at the link below. Using a site such as <A href="https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/">Marc Robledo's JS ROM patcher</a>, you should have an output file named "Mundial Ronaldinho Soccer 64 (PES 6) (Rev B)" with a resulting MD5 of 002EA28D0B5B33D3EB67E6CE4CFFE64D.</p>
	<p>The 8 MB ROM works perfectly well on emulators as well as flash carts, but because of the language barrier, I really don't know what the commentators are saying. The gameplay looks identical to ISS64; this is purely a visual and statistical update overhaul bringing it in line with the German-hosted 2006 World Cup.</p>
	<p>With the patch being held on archive.org now, I don't expect it to be removed again; however, I have taken the liberty of obtaining it and patching my own ROM dumps for archival and future review purposes.</p>
