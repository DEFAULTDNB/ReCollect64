	<h4>"Golden Recomp"</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Developer Kholdfuzion has recently made strides in giving <i>GoldenEye 007</i> the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b3">N64Recomp</a> treatment. His repo is now live and has the beginnings of a project that will load an N64 as a PC executable.</p>
	<p>The project, which is known as "GoldenRecomp", aims to give MI6's top foreign intelligence operative a fresh outing with uncapped framerates, widescreen support, modern controls, and, crucially, it will allow retexturing from the unreleased XBLA version, <i>Project Bean</i>.</p>
	<p>With the bare bones being hosted on GitHub, Kholdfuzion has only just begun, but the surrounding repos suggest he has been hard at work over the last week or so, developing links to the XBLA title from the get-go. TOML files generated from the Xbox executable (XEX), are present in a repository aptly named "beanRecomp", and are important to the Recomp process; they will aid the progress of integrating it into "GoldenRecomp".</p>

	<p>GoldenEye expert and friend of the site, Graslu00, brought the project to attention this evening by posting the above image and answering a few queries. The most important of which are summarised here:</p>

	<p>This is very early, it just means recomp is compiling to the main menu. There's no gameplay or anything yet and there's still a lot of work left to do.</p>
	<p>Remember that decompilation is a community effort and anybody with knowledge is welcome to help to speed things up!</p>

	<p><i>GoldenEye 007</i>, as an intellectual property, has been somewhat of a troublesome entity for official sources to get right. The XBLA version never saw the light of day until it leaked four years ago, confirming its ghost-like existence. Prior to this, only scraps of information and a handful of images were known.</p>
	<p>The recent re-release of GoldenEye on Xbox and Nintendo Switch saw the game horribly mistreated, with sound and graphic issues, as well as bugs and lag not seen in the original release. No care and attention was made to bring one of the greatest games ever made to a modern audience. It's still a crying shame.</p>
	<p>I have no doubts that Kholdfuzion and co. will right the wrongs that Nintendo and Microsoft could not do properly and deliver us the ultimate Secret Agent experience in the coming weeks and months.</p>
	<p>Can you help the Recomp effort? Please feel free to get in touch!</p>
