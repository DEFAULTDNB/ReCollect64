	<h4>Against the Clock</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Have you ever envisioned enhancing the performance of your N64? Overclocking may sound drastic, but for a 29-year-old system, it could be worth it to increase the performance of your console.</p>
	<p>Overclocking the 64-bit MIPS R4300i CPU from the stock 93.75 Mhz to around 125 Mhz makes for faster, smoother gameplay and quicker overall rendering speeds throughout any game you have inserted. Having a switchless mod also means that you don't have a flicky, clicky switch hanging out the end of your N64's outer shell. No case mods are required for this one; you'll just need a gamebit screwdriver to get to the system's internals.</p>
	<p>Consoles Unleashed has been active since 2018 and is an original mod kit designer who provides install services, guides and technical information for their customers. For their most recent project, they have designed a PCB to be used in conjunction with <a href="https://github.com/borti4938/N64_Switchless_Overclock">Peter Bartmann's (Borti4938) switchless overclock code for Nintendo 64</a> that helps you achieve this with the simplest install method possible.</p>

	<p><b>NEW FREE MOD RELEASE.</b></p>
	<p>Nintendo 64 Switchless Overclock PCB. A PCB designed for Borti4938's open-source N64 Overclock code.</p>
	<p>I am not gonna do a full install right now. Just a fitment test. Everything is lined up perfectly so should be good.</p>

	<h4>Like Clockwork</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Installation of these mods is typically not for the fainthearted, though this one is not overly complicated if you are handy with a soldering iron and happy with lifting a couple of legs on the CPU chip. Pins 112 and 116 control the clock multipliers and the PCB firmware is ready-tuned to give you the correct, and safe predefined output. While most games should benefit from this mod, some games will not. This is due to the fill rate of the render display pipeline (RDP) being limited by the maximum number of pixels the RDP can fill per second.</p>
	<p>The PCB needs to be flashed with Borti4938's code and can be fitted to any N64 of any region or revision. Interestingly, no additional thermal management is suggested for these mods, even with a 33% increase in clock speeds. The N64 uses simple RF shields and heat sinks to dissipate heat and is actually capable of running perfectly fine without adding any additional fans or extra thermal mitigations, up to 200% of the initial clock speed. Oddly, running into the 300% territory, or 3x overclock, prevents games from booting at all, so this +33% overclock works just enough to give your system a little boost without risk of damaging anything while playing for hours on end.</p>

	<p>All of Consoles Unleashed's PCBs will be available to purchase from their <a href="https://www.consolesunleashed.com/product/nintendo-64-switchless-overclock-mod-kit/">store front page</a> once they're made available. The N64 switchless overclock PCB retails at just $8 and takes roughly less than 30 minutes to install depending on you proficiency with console modding. Currently all projects are run in batches and are listed as "coming soon", so keep an eye out for when they appear again.</p>
	<p>While I won't be modding my N64 internally, I have no soldering skills. I can definitely see the merits of projects like this, and I hope that in future we see more of them!</p>
