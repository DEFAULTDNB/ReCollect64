	<h4>Dino De-extinction</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The most intriguing feature spotted, is the inclusion of the Brachiosaurus. The content was found in a beta ROM and restored to the treetops level. It's always interesting to see early ideas and mechanics brought back from obscurity.</p>
	<p>Hopefully, <i>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</i> and <i>Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion</i> will see the same attention, with more features and quality-of-life adjustments. I recently replayed Turok 3 on Nintendo Switch, only to get locked out of a boss fight because the game glitched. The only way around it was to restore an old save. This may have already been patched, but I would love to see more updates and features added to more N64 games on current systems.</p>
