	<h4>Aging Like Fine Wine</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When the N64 was released in Europe on March 1st 1997, Japan had already been enjoying the console for almost nine months, while <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b34" target="_blank">North America</a> had been playing for six. On the day of launch, only three games were available in Europe: <i>Super Mario 64, Star Wars Shadows of the Empire</i>, and <i>Turok Dinosaur Hunter</i>. I opted for Super Mario 64 and an additional green controller. The decision to buy a second controller for a single-player game still haunts me.</p>
	<p>It has a library of 388 games, 390 if you include variants such as <i>Super Speed Racer</i> (a JPN-exclusive revision of <i>Automobili Lamborghini</i>), and <i>HSV Adventure Racing!</i> (an Australian-exclusive version of <i>Beetle Adventure Racing!</i>). The N64 wasn't short of massive adventures to get lost in, or multiplayer titles to play with friends.</p>
	<p>The 64-bit console was the 3D powerhouse successor to the 16-bit SNES, taking graphics, sound, and gameplay to the next level. With companies like Rare, Sucker Punch, Eidos, Midway, and Rockstar publishing titles for the system over its six year reign.</p>

	<p>The Nintendo 64 was a launchpad for many up-and-coming developers, with notable games such as <i>Body Harvest</i> by DMA (who would later evolve into Rockstar North) demonstrating early ideas and mechanics that had never been done before in three dimensions, which are now staples for smash hit video games such as <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>.</p>
	<p><i>Banjo-Kazooie/Tooie, Blast Corps, Conker's Bad Fur Day, Diddy Kong Racing, Donkey Kong 64, GoldenEye 007, Jet Force Gemini, Killer Instinct Gold</i>, and <i>Perfect Dark</i> make up the sterling triple-A titles Rare put out on the N64. These games set the standard for games on the system and pushed the console far beyond the sum of its parts. Many of these games are still referenced today as standout titles that made a significant nostalgic impact on players.</p>

	<p>The box art for the European consoles was identical to that of the NA release, but the comparison to the Japanese version always amuses me. The Japanese variants always had a wonderfully unique style to them, especially on the game box art and cartridge labels.</p>
	<h4>Here's to Many More!</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The Nintendo 64 holds a special place in the collective hearts people. With a concentrated catalogue of exquisite games and lifetime sales of nearly 33 million units, the 64-bit console will hopefully experience a renaissance in 2025, with the release of the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b37" target="_blank">Analogue 3D</a> console in the next few months.</p>
	<p>My collection has stalled somewhat, with just six titles remaining to purchase to complete a world set of cartridges. I hope that I can complete my collection before the time it celebrates its big 3-0!</p>
	<p>For reference, I need <i>Bakuretsu Muteki Bangaioh, Clay Fighter Sculptors Cut, Getter Love!! Cho Renai Party Game Tanjou, Mario no Photopi, NFL Blitz Special Edition</i>, and <i>Stunt Racer 64</i>. As you can see, they are all heavy hitters, so I will have to dig deep to obtain most of those. If anyone has those available, please contact me.</p>
