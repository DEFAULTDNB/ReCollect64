	<h4>Christmas is Cooking</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The M64, Modretro's take on a modern Nintendo 64 console, has finally had a little teaser released, and it's intriguing to say the least.</p>
	<p>The 24-second-long trailer paints a nostalgic picture that we are all familiar with: a 90s-looking setup with a small CRT TV and an N64 controller in hand playing <i>Mario Kart 64</i>, but the console itself is wrapped up, and it states, "No peeking until Christmas".</p>
	<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ModRetro&#39;s newest product is M64. The best and most authentic way to play your favorite N64 games, bar none. Prepare your wallet and brace your mind.<br><br>Launches at the same price as the original Nintendo 64. Inflation isn&#39;t nostalgic. <a href="https://t.co/LYDyiBBx2O">pic.twitter.com/LYDyiBBx2O</a></p>&mdash; Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) <a href="https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1948186521737302455?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>
	<p>What's notable about this glimpse of Palmer Luckey's latest creation is that the FPGA-based machine is running Mario Kart flawlessly, and with the Jumbotron of Luigi's Raceway in full view, which is perhaps a cheeky dig at Hyperkin's yet-to-be-properly-revealed Ultra Retron, which notably struggled to get that feature working in demonstrations due to taking an emulation approach back in 2019, which clearly couldn't compete with todays more specialised FPGA solutions. He also stated:</p>

	<p>This is real gameplay on real hardware using our real core. The most efficient and accurate reimplementation of the original by far.</p>
	<p>We show off the final design and launch preorders for hardware, new titles, and re-released classics pending final legal checks.</p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
	</div>
	<p>What's interesting there is the "new titles" and "re-released classics" line, as Modretro has notably released <a href="https://modretro.com/collections/games">15 games</a> for their premium Game Boy/Game Boy Color-style handheld, the Chromatic, including a re-release of <i>Sabrina: Zapped</i>. Could the N64 see enhanced versions of existing titles? Could they end up picking some unreleased games up like Piko Interactive usually does? It remains to be seen.</p>
	<p>Lastly, Palmer specified that the price tag will mirror that of the original console's release, which in America was $199.99. Adjusting for inflation from September 1996 to July 2025, $199.99 would equate to an eye-watering $398.20 as of today, so I'm glad Moderetro has taken this stance and committed to keeping the price reasonable for N64 fans.</p>

	<p>Taking what the note says at face value, it's difficult to discern if this means a reveal around December or a fully shipped release for Christmas Day (assuming they mean Christmas 2025). Regardless, I have signed up and will be taking advantage of the early bird offers for this one!</p>
