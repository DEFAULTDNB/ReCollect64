	<h4>Evolving Emulation</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When the first N64 emulators came into existence, I cannot understate just how sceptical I was. I was at university; I had just spent my first student loan cheque on a Dell Dimension 4XXX PC (I cannot remember the exact model, but it was Pentium 4), and I wanted to use it for anything but typing up coursework. In the past, I had messed about at college with NESticle and SNES9X on floppy disks, but I wanted to push the envelope. I was convinced my shiny new 3D graphics card could do something spectacular.</p>
	<p>UltraHLE was the first emulator I remember everyone telling me to get. It didn't take much to twist my arm and get me set up; I was already a massive N64 fan, though I had shamefully left my N64 at home. I remember that trying to locate ROMs was incredibly hard. In next to no time I had the emulator set up with <i>Super Mario 64</i> and <i>Wave Race 64</i>, and I remember feeling amazed at how well it ran.</p>
	<p>A few years later, I would have Surreal64 on my OG crystal Xbox, which I got chipped on day one. It was handy living in student digs with mates on computer science courses; I just wanted to play games, they wanted to experiment on whatever tech I was into. I remember buying my PSP from a Japanese import place in London in early 2005, and by 2006 I was also playing N64 games portably thanks to Strmnnrmn's Daedalus emulator. Sure, it didn't run many games, but the ones that did were perfectly playable given the constraints of the emulator on the PSP.</p>
	<p>Nowadays, we have it so easy when it comes to N64 emulation. Our phones, tablets, laptops, and even our hacked consoles have variants of certain N64 emulators available on them. Most recently we have also had <a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp" target="_blank">Mr-Wiseguy's N64 Recompilation Project</a>, giving us slick, ultra-wide, 60 FPS gaming on our PCs for <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b65" target="_blank">Star Fox 64</a>, <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b3" target="_blank">Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask</a>, <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b11" target="_blank">Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon</a>, and I'm sure we are due one for <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b27" target="_blank">Banjo-Kazooie</a> and more soon.

	<h4>Simple Setups</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I have several setups ready to go when it comes to enjoying N64 games and content. Firstly, I have my JPN gold N64 set up at all times with an EverDrive 64 X7, <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r2" target="_blank">SummerCart64</a>, EON Super 64 HDMI cable, and a <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r9" target="_blank">Blue Retro</a> adapter for using an NSO N64 controller on the console, or if I'm out of battery, I'll use my <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r18" target="_blank">Hyperkin Hall Effect modded controller</a>.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, I do not have a capture card for my consoles, so I usually play most games twice, once on real hardware and again on something else where I can at least take screenshots.</p>
	<p>Secondly, I have the <a href="https://retroflag.com/64pi_case.html" target="blank">RetroFlag 64Pi Case</a> with a Raspberry Pi 5 built in. By running <a href="https://www.recalbox.com/" target="_blank">Recalbox</a> on it, I have access to every emulator, every core, and every ROM possible to play and take captures from. Compared to <a href="https://www.recalbox.com/" target="_blank">Recalbox</a> or <a href="https://batocera.org/" target="_blank">Batocera</a>, I'm not a huge fan of Retroarch. It has its strengths, such as the ParaLLEl core, but personally it's too complicated as a GUI especially if you're only interested in emulating N64 on it.</p>
	<p>Lastly, I have my trusty old laptop. This thing has been with me for nearly 14 years and has only ever exploded twice (it's fine, it came back to life miraculously, twice!). It's the daily driver which I use for reviewing, web design, coding, and blogging. I also set up a few emulators on this that aren't too demanding so that I can connect a controller and get captures for reviews at a moments notice.</p>
	<p>The two emulators I heartily recommend are <a href="https://github.com/Rosalie241/RMG/releases" target="_blank">Rosalie's Mupen GUI</a> and <a href="https://www.pj64-emu.com/nightly-builds" target="_blank">Project 64</a>. They're rock-solid performers that I use regularly, and having both to hand is useful if one works better than the other or if certain games play up and you cannot fathom the specific combination of plug-ins it requires quickly enough. Notably, they also run well on Steam Deck as well as other devices.</p>
	<p>Rosalie's Mupen GUI (RMG) is the Swiss Army knife of portable N64 emulation setups right now, and not nearly enough people have heard of it. It comes preconfigured with the latest cores and plugins; you just need to supply the ROMs and the controller. It's a very good emulator all round, it is also recommended for netplay, including competitive tournaments such as the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#LTKCupV" target="_blank">Goldeneye LTK Netplay Cup V</a>.</p>
	<p>Project 64 has been with me since its first release in 2001. After UltraHLE, this was pretty much <i>the</i> emulator to use because, though hacky at its core, it gets the job done. I hold a certain loyalty to this emulator and its Project64k fork (which allowed basic netplay a long time ago). I always preferred the simplicity of this emulator, especially with the plethora of plugins available. For example, Angry Lions RDP was fantastic for accuracy, GlideN64 was great for texture packs, and ParaLLEl RDP was amazing for upscaling.</p>
	<p>Before RMG, I always found Mupen was too finicky to configure. For some reason, some games worked perfectly, and others wouldn't work at all. This is not the case with RMG; it's preconfigured for the best performance and compatibility, but you still have the choice of plugins to eke out better graphics or speeds depending on your tastes. I'm very impressed with this GUI for the Mupen64plus emulator, especially because it can be used portably, so zero installation is required.</p>
	<p>Between the two of these emulators, I estimate compatibility at over 90% of the 1600+ available ROMs (including iQue, Aleck64, 64DD, and Lodgenet), ROM hacks, and translations, without having to mess about with anything at all, on 13-year-old hardware.</p>

	<h4>Honorable Mentions</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>It's worth mentioning <a href="https://parallel-launcher.ca/" target="_blank">ParaLLEl Launcher</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simple64/simple64" target="_blank">Simple64</a> as potentially great emulators, but they require better hardware than I use on this laptop. Both have seen surges in popularity over the last few months due to their simplicity and raw ability. ParaLLEl Launcher centers around the ParaLLEl core from Retroarch, and can also connect directly to <a href="https://romhacking.com/" target="_blank">Romhacking.com</a> to list possible hacks to play with each ROM.</p>
	<p>These new kids on the block tap into the raw power of the Vulkan graphics API to deliver greater performance thanks to its brilliantly efficient low-level utilisation of compatible GPUs and hardware.</p>
	<p>For these two, you'll need PCs with a CPU capable of running AVX2, and a GPU capable of running Vulkan 1.1 or higher. Sadly, my old laptop doesn't meet those requirements, so I'll have to swap to my lesser-used gaming laptop in the not-so-distant future so that I can put them to the test too.</p>
	<p>If none of what I just mentioned makes any sense, but you still want to emulate, then I implore you to try RMG or Project 64; they're so quick and simple to use, they're incredible.</p>
