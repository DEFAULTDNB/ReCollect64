	<h4>An Eye For Detail</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I have been buying Nintendo 64 cartridges on auction sites and web shops with (almost) reckless abandon for several years. I have amassed many cartridges spanning European releases, Japanese oddities, American exclusives, and interesting variants from Brazil, Mexico, and Scandinavia.</p>
	<p>You need to have your wits about you regarding the secondhand market. Unscrupulous sellers will try to get the most for their wares, and unless you read and understand their entire spiel on auction sites, you may unfortunately end up with a dud.</p>
	<p>While some are laughably obvious, some are more difficult to deduce. Luckily, there are several ways to inspect an item before purchase. In each example, I will show forgeries side-by-side with real samples for direct comparison.</p>
	<p>Follow these tips, and you will be able to tell an official game cartridge from a fake and avoid buying reproductions.</p>
	<h4>Cartridge Colour and Quality</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>	
	<p>Not many games came on a colour cartridge, just 42/388, and absolutely none of them came with a transparent shell. As cool as they look, it's always worth knowing in advance what versions exist for each game. That's another reason why the <a href="index.html" target="_blank">ReCollect64 Collectors App</a> exists!</p>
	<p>Officially made pieces have a high-quality finish, perfectly straight edges, and no rounding to any of the details. For example, the ridges that run down the front of the cart should be high-definition lines, with no softening of their edges.</p>

	<h4>The Main Label</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The front sticker of any N64 cartridge holds many features that will discern its legitimacy. The print quality, colour saturation, fine detail, shape, and placement can tell you lots about your potential purchase. A poorly shaped sticker, or one that's off-centre, is easy to tell.</p>
	<p>On European and North American carts, if the label is glossy, the imagery blurry or lacking in detail, or if the colours are overly saturated, the item is fake. Japanese games did have a glossiness to some of them. This is my favourite; check out the David Dickinson-style tan on James Bond:</p>
	<p>Not only this, but the colour of the iconic logo is incorrect, along with the scale of the gun barrel motif behind him. The NUS ID is wrong as well. The <a href="https://github.com/DEFAULTDNB/ReCollect64/blob/main/Carts/PCU/GoldenEye%20007%20PCU.png" target="_blank">"Million Seller"/"Players Choice" version of this game</a> would have the NUS ID with a trailing "-1", whereas the standard game does not. It would also have a <a href="https://github.com/DEFAULTDNB/ReCollect64/blob/main/Config/Images/PCU.png" target="_blank">Million Seller icon</a> on the cartridge if it were the Players Choice variant.</p>

	</center>	
	<h4>Ratings/Nintendo seal/Wrong NUS-ID</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>If the label looks crisp and fresh, the simplest way to detect a clone is to scrutinise the various logos and information presented; it will almost certainly be incorrect. The most obvious "tell" is if the information is whited out, if it's been digitally erased and isn't present on the label. Though high-grade pirates add the information, it's never done accurately.</p>
	<p>My favourite indicator is that of the ESRB rating having a white line around it. While some games did have an ESRB rating with a white line around it for legibility (on dark backgrounds), this game did not. The rating's colouring is also inverted; the E should be white. Look back at the GoldenEye 007 comparison above; the T is erroneously black, and it is mistakenly outlined as well.</p>
	<p>The label's main colour is also an inaccurate shade of blue. The forgery has a pink to purple gradient with stars, whereas the original has a black to blue gradient. The overall scale and position of the characters are entirely different, and the Nintendo Seal of Quality is not the right shade of gold either.</p> 
	<p>As with the above example, the below example demonstrates the same lack of diligence when the pirates have been putting this together. The NUS ID for the North American version of <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> is NUS-NBKE-USA. The forgery has NUS-NNSE-USA, the NUS ID for <i>Beetle Adventure Racing!</i></p>

		<a target="_blank" title="Fake" href="" onclick="window.open('Blog/Features/2025/SpottingFakes/SF2.png','targetWindow', 'toolbar=no, location=no, status=no, menubar=no, scrollbars=no, resizable=no, width=600px, Height=450px, top=150px left=350px'); return false;"><img class="thumbnail" src="Blog/Features/2025/SpottingFakes/SF2.png" width="30%" style="padding:auto"/></a>

	</center>
	<h4>The Back of the Cart</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>One of the easiest ways to spot a fake is to view the rear. Though sellers do not always provide images of the backs, the hind portion contains several critical pieces of information to inspect, including the overall texture of the plastic. If it's smooth and untextured, it's fraudulent. If it has a scaly appearance, especially behind the Nintendo logo, it's real.</p>
	<p>Next is the Nintendo logo. Does it look crisply embossed, with a consistent depth and a square dot above the "i"? Fakes almost always have a circular dot above the "i" because they use replica fonts.</p>
	<center>
		<a target="_blank" title="Fakest of all" href="" onclick="window.open('Blog/Features/2025/SpottingFakes/Logo1.png','targetWindow', 'toolbar=no, location=no, status=no, menubar=no, scrollbars=no, resizable=no, width=600px, Height=450px, top=150px left=350px'); return false;"><img class="thumbnail" src="Blog/Features/2025/SpottingFakes/Logo1.png" width="30%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
		<a target="_blank" title="Fake" href="" onclick="window.open('Blog/Features/2025/SpottingFakes/Logo2.png','targetWindow', 'toolbar=no, location=no, status=no, menubar=no, scrollbars=no, resizable=no, width=600px, Height=450px, top=150px left=350px'); return false;"><img class="thumbnail" src="Blog/Features/2025/SpottingFakes/Logo2.png" width="30%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
		<a target="_blank" title="Real" href="" onclick="window.open('Blog/Features/2025/SpottingFakes/Logo3.png','targetWindow', 'toolbar=no, location=no, status=no, menubar=no, scrollbars=no, resizable=no, width=600px, Height=450px, top=150px left=350px'); return false;"><img class="thumbnail" src="Blog/Features/2025/SpottingFakes/Logo3.png" width="30%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
	</center>
	<p>The label on the rear has a specific placement, colour, and information. If the label placement is shoddy or the corners don't align and look like the corner radius is different from the smooth blank spot for the label, it's usually a sign of a cheap copy.</p>
	<p>The colour should be a cool grey, not a warm, muddy-tinted grey. Check for any typos or regional inconsistencies. For example, every cartridge will say "Japan" on them, but a European cart will never say "USA-1" or "CAN-1". The stamp indented on the top right also indicates the ROM revision version, and most fakes don't bother with this detail.</p>
	<center>
		<a target="_blank" title="Fake" href="" onclick="window.open('Blog/Features/2025/SpottingFakes/Back1.png','targetWindow', 'toolbar=no, location=no, status=no, menubar=no, scrollbars=no, resizable=no, width=600px, Height=450px, top=150px left=350px'); return false;"><img class="thumbnail" src="Blog/Features/2025/SpottingFakes/Back1.png" width="30%" style="padding:auto"/></a>

	</center>
	<p>Thirdly, is the region correct? The slots on the bottom rear of the cartridge shell dictate which console it will fit into, and by extension, which region they belong to.</p>
	<p>There are three known types: NTSC-U, PAL/NTSC-J, and a third aftermarket type. NTSC-U has cut-out tabs on the outer edges. The PAL and NTSC-J ones have the tabs slightly inside the outer edges. The third type removes both tabs and allows the cartridge to fit in any console, though this does not mean that an NTSC game will run on a PAL console or otherwise because of the CIC lock-out chips.</p>

	</center>
	<p>Lastly, check the screws. Nintendo used a high-quality Torx security bit, not a common Phillips or Pozidrive screw. If the screws have an overly hexagonal shape to them, then they're also counterfeit; they should be perfectly round. Another dead giveaway is if the screw is not a screw at all; if it is moulded into the rear shell, it's a substandard duplicate.</p>

	</center>
	<h4>Circuit Board Quality</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Where possible, for ultimate verification of the game, look at the circuit board. Unscrewing the shell is easy and will not damage it in the slightest. A seller who disagrees with this is usually hiding something.</p>
	<p>The quality of components is indicative of the authenticity. You should be able to read a date on the board (1996), see "NUS" IDs stamped in multiple places, and a 16-legged CIC microcontroller, and "NINTENDO" should be branded on most of the components, particularly the board itself. Some games use battery backup for their saves, so a flat CR2032 coin cell battery and an 8-legged SRAM chip will be present.</p>
	<p>Games that had a battery included <i>1080° Snowboarding, Animal Crossing (Real Time Clock function), Dezaemon 3D, F-Zero X, Harvest Moon 64/Bokujo Monogatari 2, Major League Baseball featuring Ken Griffey Jr., Mario Golf, The New Tetris, Ogre Battle 64, Ocarina of Time, Pokemon Stadium, Pocket Monsters Stadium, Resident Evil 2, Super Smash Bros., WCW vs. nWo Revenge</i>, and <i>Wrestlemania 2000</i>.</p>
	<p>In short, if the technology within looks too neat and modern, says "ALTERA" with low-profile legs and epoxy glue over components, it's definitely a reproduction.</p>

	<h4>*REFURBISHED* Games</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>There is a paradox that states that if you have a wooden ship and you replace parts on it regularly, eventually it will be made entirely from new parts, and it is therefore no longer the original ship. The Ship of Theseus paradox also argues that if you kept all the original parts you replaced and made a ship out of them, which would be the original?</p>
	<p>If a seller cleans and tidies a cartridge, more power to them; that's a great mentality. However, if a seller removes a tatty label, replaces it with a reproduction one, swaps the back because it was discoloured, and replaces the chips, is it still the original game? I would not be happy with a game that didn't have the original label or was comprised of replacement parts, regardless of how rare or expensive the game is.</p>
	<p>There is something to be said for finding a clean, mint-condition cartridge. Especially given that the N64 is now 28 years old, finding these almost three-decade-old items in great condition for a great price is exhilarating.</p>
	<p>Realistically, you have to assume that there will be some slight wear and tear to these games; after all, it's brittle plastic and rippable paper, with rustable metal components and a corroding battery that was only built to last 15-20 years, according to the manufacturer.</p>
	<h4>Stock Images</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Another issue I see is where sellers blindly chuck up a pristine image they found online, only to send you a beat-up, filthy old game or worse, a reproduction cart.</p>
	<p>A few years ago, I purchased an Italian variant of Mission Impossible (NUS-NMII-ITA), only to be sent an atrociously fake USA reproduction that bore zero resemblance to the image the seller used to advertise their stock. As a result, I complained, got a full refund (£7), and was told to keep the cartridge.</p>
	<p>The good news about repros is that they can be re-flashed using a <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r62 target="_blank">JoeyN64</a> or any <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r12" target="_blank">flashcart dumper/writer</a>. All you have to take into consideration is the ROM size, save type, and the CIC that's been installed. <a href="https://bennvenn.myshopify.com/pages/n64-bootleg-carts" target="_blank">There is a great guide by BennVenn HERE</a>. I have since removed the label and flashed a ROM hack to that cart, so it didn't go to waste, but it's now out of circulation and won't be falling into anyone else's hands by accident.</p>
	<h4>Don't Get Stung!</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>A generally good rule of thumb is "If it looks too good to be true, it usually is"; however, the price these days does not necessarily reflect this adage. A game worth £700+ like <i>Clay Fighter Sculptors Cut</i> may be listed at £649 to appear competitive, but as a reproduction, it is barely worth the £12-15 cost of a blank cartridge.</p>
	<p>As a minor side hobby, while scouring for cheap variants, I like to message sellers who have listed items incorrectly. I always give them the benefit of the doubt, so I assume that they are unaware that what they are selling is a copy and not authentic, and I will always provide several images as proof to back up my statements. It's not exactly what a genuine seller would want to hear, and sometimes the truth hurts, but I make it my mission to deliver reality checks where needed. Some heroes don't wear capes, right?</p>
	<p>I recently checked in on a <i>Bomberman 64 The Second Attack!</i> listed as "*Authentic*" for £269, but I noticed something was off. The sticker looked great; it was straight and a good colour, but alas, a definite copy. The rear of the shell displayed the wrong embossing, and most crucially, the circuit board in the photo was white behind the connectors. The <a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nintendo_64_forever/n64-cartridge-board-scan-picture-repository-comple-t2750.html" target="_blank">majority of N64 games used green boards with a brown/yellowish connector</a> and seldom white or off-white, with the rare exceptions of <i>Ogre Battle</i> and <i>Resident Evil 2</i>. If you ever see blue, black, purple, or red, run for the hills.</p>
	<p>I checked AliExpress and found an identical item marked as a repro for just £12. In contacting the seller on eBay and explaining why it was not legitimate, along with sending photographic examples, the seller reduced the price by just £69 and removed the word "authentic". A minor victory, but I'm still unhappy that eBay will not remove items that violate piracy laws or that pretend to be real when they are verifiably counterfeit. Also, asking £200 for a £12 game is ridiculously wishful thinking.</p>
	<p>In my experience, rarely do any JPN region games get cloned. It's usually the high-value USA and PAL games that see the counterfeiters going wild, polluting the auction sites.</p>
	<p>With your newfound knowledge, I figure that you now have two options. Option one is to use these powers for good, saving yourself valuable time and money amassing a pristine collection of beautiful N64 cartridges. Option two is to take this on board and become the ultimate counterfeiting outfit.</p>
	<p>Either way, good luck!</p>
