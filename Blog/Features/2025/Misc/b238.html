	<p>ModRetro's head-honcho Palmer Lucky has finally shared an update on the M64 in the wake of the first week that patient Analogue 3D consumers have been able to at last play on their FPGA systems.</p>
	<p>Sharing a promotional video, Palmer explains that the M64 hardware will get a full reveal this coming Black Friday, which is in just three days on the 28th of November, 2025!</p>
	<p>With a brilliant pledge to keep the $199 price tag beyond early bird adopters, as well as new features, colours, and their new bespoke controller set to be revealed, I wonder if ModRetro will mirror its Chromatic line-up with "Cloud", "Leaf", "Wave" and "Midnight" colour options, or whether they will go down the more nostalgic "Funtastic" route. From this video alone, I suspect the "Smoke Grey" variant is going to be the main showstopper, but I also spy another translucent variant which, for the life of me, I cannot workout if it's orange or green.</p>
	<p>Features-wise, ModRetro could blow the A3D out of the water by simply gifting flashcart support, save states and screenshot capabilities out of the gate, let alone allowing additional cores for a multitude of alternative consoles to run on their 4K AMD-powered FPGA hardware.</p>

	<h4>Shock and Awe</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>First things first, the video. Is that an AI-generated version of <i>GoldenEye 007</i>? Is it meant to be a homage to the 90s pre-release "mockups" that you would have seen on commercials and gaming-related TV shows? What is going on there? I'm not sure.</p>
	<p>Secondly, the aesthetics of the console are interesting and perhaps divisive. The power and reset buttons are rather large, which is fine, but they're also kind of goofy-looking in my honest opinion.</p>
	<p>Lastly, the four, yes <b>FOUR</b>, cartridges they present at the end of the 40-second clip are extremely interesting. This suggests that multiple titles will be revealed that will be exclusive titles produced by ModRetro's team. Now the questions remain: will these be ports like <i>Xeno Crisis</i>, wrapped ROMs like <i>Big2Small</i>, new colour-cart variants of existing games, or has Palmer Luckey employed a team to actually build new, fully 3D Nintendo 64 games that are sympathetic to the 90s era?</p>
	<p>Hopefully all should be revealed this coming Friday, so keep 'em peeled for further information.</p>
