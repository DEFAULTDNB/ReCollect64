	<h4>Going Ape</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>A brand new, more stable, ROM patch has been released by FazanaJ that unlocks the framerate of <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i> and caps it to 30 FPS for a smoother experience. The original NTSC game runs at 240p without the use of an expansion pak, and while it had a maximum 30 FPS framerate in places, its average frame count is roughly 20 FPS, with dips of 15 FPS in places.</p>
	<p>The previous patch from FazanaJ from June 2023 was an incredibly unstable version that attempted 60 FPS with more features unlocked, including both unlockable characters and Adventure 2. That patch introduced game-breaking bugs to the extent that the game was unable to be completed. This time around, the patch has been reworked from scratch, and though it doesn't contain as many additional modifications, the additional characters and Adventure 2 remain unlocked!</p>

	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>This is based on a completely new repo that was started from scratch. It's missing a lot of features the original had, but what it does have is a smooth vanilla experience that should be playable to credits. For stability reasons, it's currently capped to 30.</p>
	<p>Patch over the initial release US ROM. NOT Revision A.</p>

	<h4>Diddy Decomp</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The patch is a result of the ongoing <a href="https://github.com/DavidSM64/Diddy-Kong-Racing">Diddy Kong Racing decompilation project</a>, which, as of May 13th, 2025, currently stands at 87.49% complete, with the documentation progress at 56.95%.</p>
	<p>As mentioned in my recent <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b131">articles</a>, decompilations can open the door to unlocking new features and assist modders in enhancing the game's codebase, even without a 100% complete byte-for-byte matching decompilation.</p>
	<p>If you wish to try out the *.BPS patch linked below, make sure your USA <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i> ROM's MD5 matches 4F0E07F0EEAC7E5D7CE3A75461888D03, which is the 1.00 ROM and not the 1.01 revision A version, and patch it using <a href="https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/">Marc Robledo's Rompatch.js site</a>.</p>
	<p>The patched ROM should have an MD5 of 4FA12E70024C81A9308835A882B1C325 and will run perfectly on any flashcart.</p>
	<p>Having given this a wizz on my ED64 X7, I have to say it's impressive to see the game run at 30 FPS with such buttery smooth gameplay in comparison to the unpatched ROM. It's quite an eye-opener!</p>
