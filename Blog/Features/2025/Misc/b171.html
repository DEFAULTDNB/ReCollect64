	<h4>Good News, Bad News</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Following the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b37">initial announcement and subsequent delay</a>, Analogue has finally broken their silence today regarding the upcoming 64-bit FPGA console. While it was due to release this month, it now appears to be pushed back until late August, but it's not all bad news.</p>
	<div class="container">
	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>Following last week’s sudden tariff changes, Analogue 3D will now begin shipping next month.</p>
	<p>We’re absorbing the costs—your preorder price stays the same. No additional charges.</p>
	<p>Late August, the wait ends: reviews go live with everything we’ve been saving for this moment.</p>
	<p>We’ve poured everything into Analogue 3D—and we can’t wait for you to see it for yourself.</p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
	</div>
	<p>It's a small 30-day extension to the waiting time, but it's great news that the price will not increase for those who have backed it from the beginning.</p>
	<p>The takeaways from this statement are that by the end of next month we will finally have the thing in our hands, and the hype train should start gearing up throughout August to whet our appetites.</p>
	<p>I would love to see some impression pieces, as well as some previews of the software and its ability, before the release day. If nothing else, for our collective minds to be put at ease regarding its capability when it comes to enhancing the N64's visuals and providing a bulletproof way to enjoy our cartridge collections.</p>
	<p>Surely there can be no backtracking now; the wait is nearly over, and the day of release is more certain than ever.</p>

		<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> 20/08/2025 - Unfortunately, Analogue has broken their staunch silence to yet again to announce a third delay, but this time it's a rather vague "Q4 2025" window.</p>

	<h4>*Waiting Intensifies*</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With this delay comes quite a wave of disappointment, especially from avid followers, myself included. This really puts a dampener on what could have been a promising summer of playing and reviewing the games I love with the 4K FPGA console.</p>
	<p>Instead, the Q4 delay, which I honestly don't hold much hope over it being delayed into 2026 at this point, puts the Analogue 3D's release window in and around that of <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b176">Modretro's M64</a>.</p>
	<p>The exact cause of the delay remains unclear. Is it the software, tariffs or perhaps the hardware itself that is causing such drama, having previously assured us it would be just one more month.</p>
	<p>The company is seeing a lot of backlash from having shown nothing of the console, despite it being previously touted to land within the next ten days. With that promise broken, and previous console launches from them going the same way, are we really surprised at this point?</p>
	<p>I will not be cancelling my preorder, which Analogue persistently repeats as an option eachtime they serve up a disappointing update. I will be holding on for dear life and following the evolvingly twisty saga to hopefully, eventually, get to play and review some games on the thing at some point in the future.</p>
	<p>What do you think of this? If you preordered, will you be cancelling? Do you think Modretro will step up with their M64 and push to release before the 3D?</p>
