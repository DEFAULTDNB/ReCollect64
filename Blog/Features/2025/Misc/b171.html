	<h4>Good News, Bad News</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Following the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b37">initial announcement and subsequent delay</a>, Analogue has finally broken their silence today regarding the upcoming 64-bit FPGA console. While it was due to release this month, it now appears to be pushed back until late August, but it's not all bad news.</p>

	<p>Following last week’s sudden tariff changes, Analogue 3D will now begin shipping next month.</p>
	<p>We’re absorbing the costs—your preorder price stays the same. No additional charges.</p>
	<p>Late August, the wait ends: reviews go live with everything we’ve been saving for this moment.</p>
	<p>We’ve poured everything into Analogue 3D—and we can’t wait for you to see it for yourself.</p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
	</div>
	<p>It's a small 30-day extension to the waiting time, but it's great news that the price will not increase for those who have backed it from the beginning.</p>
	<p>The takeaways from this statement are that by the end of next month we will finally have the thing in our hands, and the hype train should start gearing up throughout August to whet our appetites.</p>
	<p>I would love to see some impression pieces, as well as some previews of the software and its ability, before the release day. If nothing else, for our collective minds to be put at ease regarding its capability when it comes to enhancing the N64's visuals and providing a bulletproof way to enjoy our cartridge collections.</p>
	<p>Surely there can be no backtracking now; the wait is nearly over, and the day of release is more certain than ever.</p>
