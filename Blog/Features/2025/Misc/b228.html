	<h4>The Lego of Zelda</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>This afternoon, Nintendo of America posted a teaser trailer for their next Lego set based on <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i>. With the strap line "Do you realize who you're dealing with?" and a very recognisible sound in the background, are they teasing the final battle with Gannondorf, or are they teasing something more?</p>

	<h4>Build The Legend</h4>

	<p>With their last set, the Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 set (77092) retailing for £259.99 and containing 2500 pieces, my spider-senses tell me that the set they will be announcing could also be a 2-in-1 kit with Gannon on his horse or Gannon in his hulking final form.</p>
	<p>We will just have to wait and see what is on offer when Nintendo finally drops the info in 2026. What are your thoughts? What do you suspect it could be? Some people have surmised that it could be an "Inside The Great Deku Tree" playset, or perhaps Hyrule Castle itself!</p>
