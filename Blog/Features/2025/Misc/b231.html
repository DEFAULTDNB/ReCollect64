	<h4>Expansion Unpacked</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As you know, the 4 MB Expansion Pak for the Nintendo 64 was released in 1998, just two years after the release of the console, and for all intents and purposes, its main function was to bring higher resolutions, increased frame rates, and, in some cases, better texture support for compatible games. But was this the only reason?</p>
	<p>While some games benefitted, others, ironically, suffered at the hands of janky frame rates and minuscule letter-boxed screen ratios which rendered the games less playable than their lower-resolution standard-definition counterparts. Could it be that the Expansion Pak wasn't a worthwhile upgrade?</p> 
	<p>In this article, I'm going to share a couple of points of knowledge I have picked up over the years and some 64DD-related information, as well as presenting some freshly uncovered facts from a well-known N64 scene developer.</p>

	<h4>Expanded Essentials</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The list of Expansion Pak-compatible games is quite extensive (see below), but the list of games that required it is somewhat shorter. There are in fact just three, though one of those is still partially playable with just the standard jumper pack inserted.</p>
	<p><a href=""><i>Donkey Kong 64</i></a> is the first game on this short list that actively required the Expansion Pak to function. Without it inserted, the game would simply greet you with a screen stating that the pak was required in order for it to function.</p>
	<p>There has been a lot of conjecture as to the exact reason why DK64 needs the Pak at all, including the myth that a game-breaking bug was present in the code and the additional memory of the Expansion Pak allowed the game to run for far longer before the bug would become present. The truth is that the game was designed around the Expansion Pak; it was implemented extremely early on during development, and Nintendo asked Rare to make the Expansion Pak a selling point.</p>
	<p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</i> is the next game that actively requires the Expansion Pak, and the reason behind it is basic. In order for Eiji Aonuma, Yoshiaki Koizumi, and Shigeru Miyamoto's sequel to <i>Ocarina of Time</i> to work with the three-day cycle and the enhanced graphics, the Expansion Pak's additional memory was crucial to keeping everything in check. Tracking NPCs, rendering multitudes of characters on screen at once and skipping forwards and backwards in time was quite complex for a console game in the year 2000.</p>
	<p>Originally, OOT was planned to have a 64DD add-on expansion that would allow it better graphics and new dungeons, but ultimately because of the 64DD's poor sales, Majora's Mask would become a sequel that remixed the original engine and character models from OOT but improved resolution and memory handling thanks to the Expansion Pak.</p>
	<p>The last game that technically required the Expansion Pak is <i>Perfect Dark</i>. Though the game would run if inserted without one, the only options available were a vastly cut-down multiplayer combat simulator and some challenge modes.</p>
	<p>With the 4MB pak inserted, <i>Perfect Dark</i> would give you access to the full single-player campaign, full 4-player multiplayer with a maximum of eight simulants (bots), cooperative and counter-operative modes, and the game could run in high definition!</p>

	<p></p>
	<h4>Expansive Titles</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Approximately 60 titles took advantage of the N64's memory add-on, with games like <i>Gauntlet Legends, Hydro Thunder</i> and <i>StarCraft 64</i> requiring the expansion pak to run their various multiplayer modes but not being required to play the base single-player campaigns or race modes.</p>
	<p>Games such as <i>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</i> and the Tony Hawk's Pro Skateboarding trilogy showcased sharper graphics and smoother frame rates by utilising the extra RAM, but it is notable that games such as <i>Conker's Bad Fur Day, Banjo-Tooie</i>, and <i>Jet Force Gemini</i> never required the Expansion Pak yet managed to deliver iconic visuals and impressively smooth gameplay regardless, albeit at slightly reduced resolutions, such as 292x214 in Conker, to compensate for detail.</p>
	<p>Where a stock N64 typically outputs at 320x240, Expansion Pak enhanced games allowed for a wider gamut of bespoke resolutions that included 640x222, 640x240, 640x480, 400x440, 480x360, interlaced or progressive, and switching from 30 Hz to 60 Hz refresh rates, for example. Regardless of the Pak, games rarely output at the maximum 640x480, which most people assumed to be the enhanced default, though Vigilante 8 did manage through its "Ultra resolution" mode. More often, many enhanced titles stood at around 480x360, or 640x222, depending on screen ratio.</p>
	<p>Notable games that suffered laggy inputs and tanked frame rates as a result of enabling high-resolution modes were <i>Armorines Project S.W.A.R.M., ISS 2000, Duke Nukem: Zero Hour</i>, and <i>Star Wars Rogue Squadron</i>. Almost all games that opted to give you a higher resolution mode sacrificed framerate to output higher definition graphics, but why this sacrifice had to be made and why anyone thought that a 5-10 FPS game with a bigger output resolution would be acceptable remains a mystery to me.</p>

	<h4>Expanded Knowledge</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>It came to light <a href="https://x.com/KazeEmanuar/status/1867959214095892960?s=20">at the very end of last year</a> that the Nintendo 64 is actually holding 4.5 MB of memory and that the Expansion Pak also held 4.5 MB of memory, making a theoretical total of 9 MB, not 8.</p>
	<p>Research by Kaze Emanuar recently unearthed this groundbreaking fact when the SM64 ROM hacker was poking about with the data in between the 8 readable bits. Accessing the 9th bit by abusing hardware quirks unlocks a hidden half a megabyte of usable data that is usually unseen by the CPU.</p>
	<p>As pointed out by Kaze, the 9th bit is only utilised properly by one game, <i>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</i>, when the Lens of Truth is in use. Using this information, it may allow ROM hackers to increase what they can do with their current homebrew projects, but this remains to be seen. I'm hopeful that Kaze might incorporate this into his wonderfully technologically advanced <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b69">RTYI ROM hack</a>, which already runs stunningly well on real hardware!</p>
	<p>Regardless, you can see the full video here, which explains everything in far better terms than I could ever wish to:</p>

	<h4>Pak Repacked</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When Rare began production on <i>Jet Force Gemini</i> in 1997, the Expansion Pak was not ingrained within public knowledge and not something every player would jump on board with immediately. Opting to create the game without the requirement of the add-on pak, the team released <i>Jet Force Gemini</i> in 1999 to critically positive reception, with some outlets commenting on how good the game looks and feels even without the need for additional RAM.</p> 
	<p>Through production, there was an idea to add a high-resolution mode, but it was cut from the final build. You can still trace unused references to this mode in the retail ROM. As a result of this possible inclusion, the game was initially printed with the Expansion Pak icon as well as the Rumble Pak icon, indicating that the add-on would be compatible with the game, but it wasn't, so game boxes were re-stickered to only reflect the Rumble Pak compatibility.</p>
	<p>This misprint, and the stickered variant boxes, can fetch more money than the version with the updated artwork, so check your collections today!</p>

	<h4>Expanded Knowledge</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Typically, N64 games that didn't require the Expansion Pak would still run with an Expansion Pak inserted, and there would be no effect. The only game that didn't work properly with an Expansion Pak installed, that didn't make use of the Pak at all, was <i>Space Station Silicon Valley</i>, a game developed by none other than DMA, now known as Rockstar North, that incorrectly addressed memory and led to a game-breaking crash if the Expansion Pak was present. The solution in 1998 was to simply reprint the game, so the USA ROM 1.1 went into circulation, and the European version was based on the revised ROM that patched the crash.</p>
	<p>Do you have the 1.00 or 1.01 (REV A) variant? You can check the rear label of a cartridge to see the stamped codes. If it contains "XXA" it's a revised ROM and should be patched, but if it just has "XX", it's the original bugged-out ROM.</p>
	<p>Recently I stumbled upon a simple GameShark code that can be used on virtually any game to allow it to bypass the inbuilt Expansion Pak and display the game as if it were running purely in an unexpanded capacity.</p>
	<p>Without needing to swap the Expansion Pak for the OG Jumper Pak, you can use any GameShark-compatible cheat or conversion device (flashcarts work too). Entering the code <b>"EE000000 0000"</b> and starting the game will disable the game from detecting inserted Expansion Pak!</p>
	<p>Games like <i>Castlevania, Resident Evil 2</i> and, of course, <i>Space Station Silicon Valley</i> v1.00, for example, can benefit from not utilising the Expansion Pak at all by disabling it. Doing so can lock the FPS and resolutions down to the bare minimum, fixing issues like tanking framerates or resolution switching that can cause games to reach unplayable levels of unacceptability for many players.</p>

	<h4>The Double D Stunner</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Though the Expansion Pak was a neat little upgrade to pop in the top, many European and American Nintendo fans will always wonder why Nintendo never continued the trend of lifetime bolt-on upgrades nor made use of the expansion port on the bottom of the console.</p>
	<p>As we are all aware nowadays, the Nintendo 64DD was an add-on that allowed the Nintendo 64 to run disk-based games, expansion kits, and even go online, but the peripheral never made it away from Japan's shores. The 64DD required the Expansion Pak to function, and due to the lacklustre success of the disk drive, Nintendo decided to simply repurpose the Expansion Pak to become the miniature upgrade many cartridge games could easily take advantage of.</p>
	<p>Without the 64DD releasing in other territories, Nintendo would have had surplus stock of these upgrades knocking about, so this decision was pretty smart IMHO. It is also one of the first known home console upgrades, as opposed to home computer upgrades, which improved the base hardware for many hardcore 64-bit fans. Ultimately, the 4MB upgrade was not compulsory for 99% of the library, but if you wanted to unlock all functionality and modes in all compatible games or play <i>DK64, TLOZ:MM or Perfect Dark</i> in full, you would need to stump up the additional thirty quid.</p>
