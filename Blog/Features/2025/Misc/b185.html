	<p>In an exciting follow-up to the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b149">previous posts</a>, jnmartin has now released the first version of his impressive <i>Mario Kart 64 Dreamcast port</i>, which makes full use of the <a href="https://github.com/n64decomp/mk64"><i>Mario Kart 64</i> decompilation project</a> as well as KallistiOS.</p> 
	<p>Sega's Dreamcast never had a mascot racing game of its own during its lifetime, and previous attempts to emulate the N64 version on the Dreamcast have always run painfully slow and glitchy in comparison to this spiffy full-speed native port.</p>
	<p>Notably, Sonic the Hedgehog does not feature in this initial release of the port, though he was touted as a replacement for Toad in previous WIP updates provided by Falco Girgis, and would have injected a little bit of Sega's DNA to the port.</p>
	<p>The port features 4-player support, full working sound thanks to <a href="https://x.com/falco_girgis">Falco Girgis</a>, fixed (unmappable) controls and VMU save support. In order to play the game, you will have to build it yourself, as no CDI/ISO is provided, though full instructions as to how to do so can be found on the GitHub link below.</p>

	<p>Here's a fantastic demonstration video provided by <a href="https://x.com/VEsoterica">Video Game Esoterica</a> testing out the port, and as you can see, it's pretty bulletproof, barring a couple of extremely minor alignment issues in the text here and there.</p>

	<p>No doubt we will see bug fixes and mods find their way to the Dreamcast iteration in due course, but for now, it's time to enjoy the nostalgic racer, in all its glory, on your Dreamcasts, FPGA systems, or even emulators!</p>
	<p>Focus for the DC porting team will now turn towards the recently announced <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b182"><i>Star Fox 64</i></a> port, and hopefully we might see the beginnings of more ports (<a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b184">fingers crossed for <i>Wave Race 64</i></a>) very soon!</p>
