	<h4>Creative Celebration</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Earlier this week we were treated to what can only be described as an incredibly creative 9-minute fusion of one of the best Zelda games ever made and one of the most renowned animation studios to ever exist. Together, these craft the perfect medley of fantasy and reality with a gorgeous hand-drawn-looking dark-side aesthetic, with purposefully stylised choppy frame rates.</p>
	<p>RwanLink has spent the last 8 months putting in 40-hour weeks (that's a staggering 9700+ hours) to bring this stylised vision of Eiji Aonuma and Yoshiaki Koizumi's <i>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</i> into the Ghibli animated aesthetic, just in time for the game's 25th anniversary celebrations in North America and Europe (October/November).</p>
	<p>Using Unreal Engine 5 and recreating all the major recognisable locations across Termina, RwanLink has put together the ultimate love letter to the culturally influencial and highly revered adventure game.</p>
	<p>As a lifelong fan of Majora's Mask, I have to say that I was completely drawn into this animation from start to finish. The captivating dramatic heft of the scenes really pulls at me and bathes me in nostalgia for the game. Where many were divided on the games' mechanics as well as the dark and emotionally deep storyline, I was a huge fan of all of it, and I still am!</p>

	<h4>Admirable Animation</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The atmosphere is captured and portrayed perfectly here, with scenes such as the fight with Majora's Wrath displaying the epic battle and the catastrophic fear of the villagers as their world comes crashing down around them. The rewinding and replaying of time and events is explored, and the metamorphosis of Link into the Fierce Deity to overcome Majora and the love story between Kafei and Anju are incredible to see expressed so vividly.</p>
	<p>There are a vast number of recognisable characters represented, including Zeniba and Kaonashi (Spirited Away), and they are animated beautifully in this theatrical spectacle. Though there is not a single line of dialogue uttered, the storytelling is immense and the vision of the cinamatography is utterly superlative.</p>
	<p>The final 6 minutes of video exemplify the engine used and the quality of characters, objects, textures, and assets created. This was designed from the perspective of a film director, not as a game, though RwanLink shows a third-person walk-around of the environment, with Link exploring Clock Town and the inhabitants in blisteringly high definition. Just imagine if it was a game!</p>
	<p>Across RwanLink's illustrious 16-year career on YouTube, he has previously crafted numerous Zelda-adjacent animations, including building backstories and spin-offs using characters and storylines from <i>Ocarina of Time, Twilight Princess</i> and, more often than not, <i>Majora's Mask</i>. Each one has improved on the last, and every one tells a unique story and demonstrates the evolution of RwanLink's incredible animation skills.</p>
	<p>If you're a Zelda fan, I highly recommend you give his channel a look because it is packed with fantasic content!</p>
