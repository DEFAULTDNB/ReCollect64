	<p>The year is 2025, and as <i>GoldenEye 007</i> has just celebrated its 28th passage of time circling the Sun in August, we are still getting interesting hacks and mods for the iconic stealth action shooter!</p>
	<p>The latest modification to hit my timeline is none other than an aimbot implemented by software developer and security researcher <a href="https://x.com/x86matthew">x86matthew</a> through MIPS patching, a cheater's dream method of automating aiming and firing with superhuman reaction times, which is significantly advantageous for waltzing through levels. Thankfully the hack only applies to single-player gaming, as it would absolutely obliterate anyone entering into multiplayer.</p>

	<p><b>GoldenEye 007 N64 Aimbot Patch</b></p>
	<p>A binary ROM patch for GoldenEye 007 (N64) that implements a screen-wide aimbot with auto-fire for single-player mode. The game already has a built-in "aim-assist" feature which locks onto enemies that are already near the crosshair - this existing logic has been "recycled" and modified to cover the entire field of view. The aim adjustment speed has also been increased, and unlike the original feature, the weapon now automatically fires when a target is acquired.</p>
	<p><b>Details</b></p>
	<p>Increasing the threshold of the built-in auto-aim feature only requires a few simple patches to the existing MIPS instructions.</p>
	<p>Adding the auto-fire feature was slightly more complicated. This additional logic required a trampoline, with the additional code inserted into unused ROM space. This new code cycles the trigger when the auto-aim feature is locked onto a target.</p>
	<p><b>Usage</b></p>
	<p>For legal reasons, the modified ROM is not available to download directly from this repository.</p>
	<p>You must first acquire the original ROM file: GoldenEye 007 (U) [!].z64</p>
	<p>SHA256: 2cdcec8a9f0cb6e36337f3ee39d8ad105dc8afa6ba1c02d466e8f5b771f9a162</p>
	<p>SHA1: abe01e4aeb033b6c0836819f549c791b26cfde83</p>
	<p>The bytes listed in <a href="https://github.com/x86matthew/GoldeneyeAimbot/blob/main/patched_bytes.txt">patched_bytes.txt</a> can then be applied to this ROM file.</p>

	<h4>Cheaters Never Prosper</h4>

	<p>It goes without saying that this type of hack has only one reason for use, meaning that there is very little chance of seeing it used for contests, speedrunning, or daily use; however, as a proof of concept and a project undertaken by x86matthew to implement something into the game, it remains extremely impressive to behold.</p>
	<p>The technical wizardry required to write a MIPS mod like this, implementing features that didn't exist in this form, is always interesting to see. Who knows what else we might see patched into this game by the time it levels up to 30 years of age.</p>
