	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>SonicDcer has done it again! Within just days of the previous news, he's released an alpha build of the static recompilation for the <a href="https://github.com/sonicdcer/DNZHRecomp/releases">recently decompiled Duke Nukem: Zero Hour!</a> using <a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp">Mr-Wiseguy's N64: Recompiled</a> toolset. The first version was unplayable, but the second actually lets you get in-game and try it out!</p>
	<p>As of four days ago, <a href="https://github.com/sonicdcer/DNZHRecomp/releases">alpha 0.0.2</a> is the latest version that has been made publicly available, but it already boasts mappable controls, rock-solid 30 FPS/60 Hz, 60 FPS/120 hz, and 120 FPS/240 hz frame rates depending on your monitor, though widescreen has not yet been implemented. We just need to give SonicDcer more time to cook!</p>
	<p>As with all static recompilations, you will need the ROM in order to extract the assets and play. The one you'll need is the <i>Duke Nukem Zero Hour</i> Z64 USA ROM with an MD5 of 026789D47DB5FE202A76F89797B33AC7. Once you have that, simply place it in the root of the directory, and run the EXE to get started.</p>

	<p>As we know, the DC port is already being looked into by JNmartin83, but the swiftness that these recompilations are coming from raw base code to playable is startling. What we can glean from this release is that the development tools for building these recomps are becoming more versatile and easier to apply to any new decompilation code that comes along. That's not to say that each game won't require tweaking and polishing, but the remarkable efforts of people like SonicDcer, the Harbour Masters, and JNmartin are now definitely paying off dividends for them to quickly make strides with each new project.</p>
	<p>These are exciting times for <i>Duke Nukem</i> fans, as this game was previously only playable on N64 or PC via emulation, but now that recompilations and native ports are becoming available, the game now runs far better and is now better preserved for a new wave of gamers to kick ass and chew bubble gum with.</p>
