	<p>Palmer Luckey, of ModRetro fame, has today given us a little glimpse behind the curtain of the M64's progress, and it's an interestingly short-but-sweet post, to say the least.</p>
	<p>With the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b171">Analogue 3D an increasingly delayed no-show</a>, Palmer and his gang have dropped a small mission-style statement and video clip that gives a little insight into the inner workings and in fact, proof that this thing exists and works, while also throwing up a couple of new questions, least of all "where is the cartridge plugged in?" and "what will the shell look like?".</p> 
	<p>On display is what appears to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xilinx">Xilinx</a>-powered FPGA setup, laid bare, running <a href="https://x.com/AzumFpg">Robert Peip, aka FPGAzumSpass</a>',s incredible N64 core. The core is running <i>Mario Kart 64</i> at 30-31 FPS (the frame counter gives away the core in use), at least during a race replay, but notably, the looping eight-second video doesn't show anything of actual gameplay, nor of a cartridge plugged in. It has clearly been very carefully positioned to not give away all of its secrets just yet.</p>

	<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One common question I get regarding the (not yet released) ModRetro M64 is &quot;Why not just use an original N64?&quot;<br><br>Very reasonable to ask!

	<h4>Core Blimey</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>For anybody wondering, the N64 core in use is governed by a <a href="https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/N64_MiSTer/blob/main/LICENSE">GNU General Public License v3.0</a>, which allows commercial use, modification, distribution, patent use, and private use by anyone, including companies such as ModRetro.</p>
	<p>The USP of the M64 that is being pushed appears to be the ease of use and connectivity with modern TVs with the demonstration proving that connectivity only requires an HDMI cable and doesn't need the user to purchase expensive accessories or mod kits to achieve this. There has still been no official confirmation as to whether the M64 will output in 4K yet, but a 720p image upscaled to 1080p would still look excellent.</p>
	<p>I love to see the passive rivalry heating up between ModRetro and Analogue, even if it's entirely one-sided right now, because it will eventually give more players more ways to experience the best console ever made!</a>
