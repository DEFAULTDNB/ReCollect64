	<p>The previously reported <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b11">Mystical Ninja Recompilation project</a> from July 2024 has received a nice little update this week by adding mod and macOS support as well as a few more notable features:</p>
	<div class="container">
	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>Wondering about your save data when upgrading? Don't worry! Your save data is stored separately to the game itself. You can overwrite your old version and your save data will still be there, completely intact, and will work on the new version.</p>
	<p>Modding support has been added. Mods can be installed by dragging them onto the game window or by using the "Install Mods" button in the mod menu before starting the game. More info can be found in the readme.</p>
	<p>Texture pack support has been added. Texture packs are managed with the same menu as mods and installed in the same way.</p>
	<p>MacOS is now supported via a Metal renderer. Thanks @dcvz and @tanmaysachan!</p>
	<p>Many graphical optimizations have been added to improve performance on lower end GPUs.</p>
	<p>Various UI tweaks and improvements.</p>
	<p>A flatpak has been added for the Linux version. Please note that the AppImage has been removed due to some file picker issues it had.</p>

	<p>This release makes the game far more customisable with redub and texture switching with zero effort, and the slew of UI tweaks brings better overall ease of use for Windows, Linux, and now also macOS users!</p>
