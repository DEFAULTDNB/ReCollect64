	<h4>For Fox Sake</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Having reported back in August that the <i>Star Fox 64</i> Dreamcast port by jnmartin83 was <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b182"><i>in progress</i></a>, Falco Girgis has recently shared news that the port is now approximately 95% complete and could be with us sooner rather than later.</p>
	<p>This sliky-smooth video-based progress update lifts our spirits and gives us all hope that the project might come by way of an early Xmas present, but ultimately, there is no set release date for this to become publicly playable. So we wish the team all the best in their efforts!</p>

	<h4>Possible Ports</h4>

	<p>With each decompilation comes hope that another game will get a Dreamcast port. Though <i>Perfect Dark</i> has not been publicly started yet and would make a superb 4-player experience on Sega's last console, there are plently more decompiled N64 titles that could be secretly in production. As always, we must temper our expectations.</p>
	<p>Recently, Falco also hinted that jnmartin83 has already been sifting through the files for <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b220">the recently decompiled <i>Duke Nukem: Zero Hour</i></a>, so I have no doubt that in 2026, Dreamcast-owning Nintendo 64 fans will have a lot to look forward to playing!</p>
