	<h4>A Frosty Reception</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When <i>Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero</i> first debuted, I think it's fair to say that critics and fans alike were distinctly divided. While some saw this as an interesting and puzzle-fuelled break from the traditional format, others saw it as a poorly made yet punishing "Kash-in" of a beloved franchise which ultimately tainted the whole idea of creating more "Mythologies" games as its own spin-off series.</p>
	<p>Ultimately, no more "Mythologies" games were made, but today, with the <i>Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection</i> due to release before the year is out, Ed Boon and co. are still teasing more upcoming "Kontent" for the game, and today, eagle-eyed fans and modders <a href="https://x.com/thethiny">@TheThiny</a> and <a href="https://x.com/TheCl0wn85">@TheCl0wn85</a> have provided <a href="https://x.com/thethiny/status/1958111209011757243/photo/1">possible proof</a> of the Marmite-like game "Koming" soon to the "Kollection", along with <i>Mortal Kombat: Special Forces</i>.</p>

	<h4>Killer Kollective</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The leaks, though unconfirmed, are interesting nonetheless, as <i>Mortal Kombat: Mythologies Sub-Zero</i> was only released for the PlayStation and N64 in 1997, so this iteration is possibly an HD port of either one or the other version, with the PlayStation outing providing a superior experience thanks to the included live-action cutscenes on its spacious disc, though the N64 version's loading times were significantly faster due to the cartridge format.</p>
	<p>The <i>Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection</i> is already set to feature <i>MK1,MK2, MK3, Ultimate MK3, Mortal Kombat Trilogy</i> (PS version) as well as the arcade edition of <i>Mortal Kombat 4</i>, and the GBA versions of <i>MK: Advance, Deadly Alliance</i>, and <i>Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition</i>. These new additions mean that the tally of games and versions included sits at around the 22 mark, with versions spanning SNES, Genesis, Game Gear, Arcade and Game Boy.</p>
