	<h4>Portable Pedigree</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I have a penchant for consoles like the PS Vita, a portable console that was dismissed before it could flourish, but nowadays, the console has far more intriguing games and brew than it ever officially garnered during its woefully short and undersupported lifespan.</p>
	<p>Case in point, we have the return of PS Vita Bounties, a system deployed by the community to give developers the impetus to keep their favourite handheld alive and kicking. Recently, a new wave of bounties, hosted by Chuck Zealous, has shown that Nintendo 64 games are highly viable and reasonably requested for porting to the system.</p>
	<p>The bounty system means that anyone willing can contribute towards the totals, and any interested developers can pick up some cash, making it far more worthy of their time and effort when porting projects to the Vita.</p>

	<p>As we know, Rinnegatamante has already provided several wonderful N64 ports to the PS Vita, including <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b156"><i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i></a> and <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b139"><i>Perfect Dark</i></a>, but fans of the 64-bit system are now clamouring for more of the feature-rich native ports to land on their handhelds, such as <a href="https://github.com/HarbourMasters/2ship2harkinian">2Ship2Harkinian</a> (<i>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</i>), <a href="https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Starship">StarShip</a> (<i>Star Fox 64</i>), and <a href="https://github.com/HarbourMasters/SpaghettiKart">SpaghettiKart</a> (<i>Mario Kart 64</i>).</p>
	<p>Currently, the bounty for a <i>Majora,s Mask</i> port sits at $80, and <i>Star Fox 64 (Lylat Wars to those in Europe)</i> is just $10, but there is still plenty of time to add to this, increasing the pot and enticing and supporting developers to port your favourite games to the system as soon as humanly possible.</p>
