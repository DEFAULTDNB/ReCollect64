	<h4>Retro Revivals</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Toys for Bob, a name synonymous with the <i>Crash Bandicoot</i> and <i>Spyro the Dragon</i> trilogy remakes, has hinted at being interested in bringing back the bear and bird combo to new audiences. Toys for Bob is a solid Team Xbox partner, and the plethora of rights held by Microsoft, the owner of Rare and the <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> IP, provides us with a tantalising glimpse into their possible future plans for retro-mascot platforming titles or remakes.</p>
	<p>The company, which became an independent studio in 2024, was recently interviewed by Crash/Spyro aficionado and YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CanadianGuyEh777">Canadian Guy Eh</a>. Toys for Bob's creative director Paul Yan went on record as saying, "I think we can all agree Banjo's been hibernating long enough, right?"</p>
	<p>Toys For Bob famously brought Crash and Spyro back to the mainstream in 2018, after they formed their titular trilogies 18-20 years prior. The reception for these remasters was huge, with the people who originally bought the games as kids being able to relive their youth in HD with adult money and a new wave of players being introduced to the franchises and mascots. With <i>Crash 4: It's About Time</i> launching in 2020, it's unironically "about time" that a <i>Spyro</i> follow-up should be making waves according to industry speculation, and some small purple-coloured hints dropped by Paul Yan.</p>

	<h4>Hibernating Hopes</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Now, the fact that Toys for Bob wants to get involved with Rare and <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> could be a fantastic thing for Microsoft, reinvigorating the now stagnant franchise by either remastering the original two games or producing an entirely new entry in the series. Perhaps a spiritual <i>Banjo-Threeie</i> will get to see the light of day!</p>
	<p>What we do know is that the company has not produced any concepts, ideas, or mock-ups yet; everything is purely speculation, hopes and dreams based on a couple of exciting remarks. Anything that might happen for the fluffy-feathery combo could be years away yet.</p>
	<p>Microsoft last gave our nostalgic honey bear an outing with the remastered 1998 platformer in 2008 on Xbox Live Arcade, thanks to 4J Studios Ltd. I think I speak for the majority when I say that <i>Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts</i> was not a great entry in the series, departing from the platformer mechanics altogether, and though it scored a commendable 7/10 review average, it is probably the reason why the duo has been shelved for the past 17 years.</p>
