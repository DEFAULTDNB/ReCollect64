	<p>Mod Retro has today announced that a unit of their hotly anticipated M64 console will be publicly playable at an upcoming event at the Portland Convention Center. The team will have their 64-bit FPGA console operational from October 17th to 19th, inviting fans to "plug in the memories" at booth 601.</p>
	<p>The M64 was <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b103">initially teased back in March</a>, and a tentative <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b176">early bird price of £199 was subsequently declared in July</a>, followed by their most recent information, <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b194">a video of the unit in action, posted by Palmer Luckey, in August</a>.</p>

	<h4>Halloween Hype Train</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With the console's price locked in for early bird adopters until Halloween (October 31st), and a physically playable console being revealed to the public slightly beforehand, this lends even more credence to the idea that their FPGA-based Nintendo 64 might be in our hands just in time for the Christmas holidays.</p>
	<p>I have been signed up for the early bird price since it was first publicised, so if you plan on taking advantage of this, you might want to head over to the site and register your interest today.</p>
	<p>Rest assured, once I have one in my midst, I will be giving it a full hands-on review and a full workover with all of my cartridge collection, so stay tuned for further updates!</p>
