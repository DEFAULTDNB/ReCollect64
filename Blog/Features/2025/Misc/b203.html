	<h4>Perfected Port</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The incredible Perfect Dark PC port has been receiving quite a few swish updates of late, the first of which is the ability to use HD textures and swap them on the fly, and the second is that there is an all-in-one pack which combines over 70 arenas for you to use in conjunction with the 25-year-old game!</p>
	<p>The <a href="https://www.emutalk.net/threads/perfect-dark-texture-pack-wip-perfect-dark-forever.57318/">Perfect Dark Forever</a> version 0.7.d HQ texture pack is a community project that combines over 2300 textures into one easy-to-use pack; you can just drag and drop the folder into the correct directory and then easily transform the look of Perfect Dark with a simple toggle.</p>
	<p>The AIO mod is another collection, this time of levels, which handily combines lots of smaller modifications into one big more manageable selection:</p>

	<p><b>About All in One Mod:</b></p>
	<p>I am testing importing mods for the N64 into the PC port.</p>
	<p>The current mod feature is incomplete and the source code needs to be modified.</p>
	<p>This mod is a combine of several multiplayer mods into one.</p>
	<p><b>Currently 71 arenas are available to play in.</b></p>
	<p>Normally, there is only one mod that can be loaded, but in this mod, the mechanism is to switch mods depending on the arena selected.</p>
	<p>This mod is experimental and may have bugs and for Windows.</p>
	<p>For non-Windows, please download from the following page.</p>
	<p>port: https://github.com/jonaeru/perfect_dark/actions/runs/16384337252 (expires in 90 days by GitHub)</p>
	<p>port-net: (In preparation)</p>
	<p>Includes gamecontrollerdb text file which enables N64 controller compatibility if you use a Raphnet adapter, among all other types of controllers you may use.</p>

	<p>The levels, which are a brilliant compilation of packs such as Goldfinger 64, Perfect Dark Plus, GoldenEye X, and the "All Solos in Multi", include classics like Dark Noon, Grand Library, Icicle Pyramid, Rogue Control Centre, the mind-bending Paradox arena, and yes, Kakariko Village is in there too!</p> 
	<p>Below is a demonstration video, captured by Perfect Dark enthusiast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Atari-Dude">Atari-Dude</a>, showing the HD texture support as well as the levels Grid, Complex, Area 52, and Sewers:</p>

	<h4>Perfect Start</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Around September last year there was chatter of getting HD texture support functional with the PC port, but it's taken almost a year to come to fruition, and it is not quite perfect yet. There are some notable text alignment issues and missing HD textures, where SD textures remain.</p>
	<p>With this being just a humble beginning to what is possible with the ported decompiled project, it's interesting to imagine what other delights we might see for Rare's iconic shooter. Perhaps in the future we may see things like VR support, where you could be playing Perfect Dark on your favourite VR headset, or perhaps more reasonable would be the ability to add back in beta features such as "Perfect Head" functionality: the transfer pack and Game Boy camera-related feature which was removed from the final game over Nintendo's fears that it would incight real-world violence by scanning in and shooting each other's faces.</p>
	<p>The sky is the limit once a game is fully decompiled, it just takes the right people to pick it up and run with it in their own directions.</p>
