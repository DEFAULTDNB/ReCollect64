	<p>In what can only be classed as the hottest morsel of information this week, Falco Girgis has tipped the 1996 aquatic racer to be high on the Dreamcast porting crew's hit list!</p>

Idk if it&#39;ll be ready to be THE NEXT port, but this is one of the few ports that I feel confident saying will probably happen before one of us dies. lol</p>&mdash; Falco Girgis (@falco_girgis) <a href="https://twitter.com/falco_girgis/status/1953493262095786067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

	<p>The interesting information that can be extrapolated from this statement is that <a href="https://x.com/SonicDcer">SonicDcer</a> is onboard, and therefore the WR64 decompilation effort might just be going well enough to almost have <i>Wave Race 64</i>'s source code nearing a state of usefulness behind the scenes, though <a href="https://github.com/LLONSIT/Wave-Race-64">publicly</a> the US version's decompilation sits at around 37.85% complete, as of today.</p>
	<p>The hype will have to remain hype for now though, as jnmartin and co. have just released <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b185"><i>Mario Kart 64</i></a> publicly, and have recently announced working on <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b182"><i>Star Fox 64</i></a>, so <i>Wave Race 64</i> might take a long while yet before we get to see anything surface.</p>
	<p>On the same subject, it would be great to see <i>Wave Race 64</i> get the recompilation treatment too, as the game is also a <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r68">personal favourite of mine</a>, and it is more than deserving of some modern features and attention. In any case, I am eagerly anticipating any new developments or information!</p>
