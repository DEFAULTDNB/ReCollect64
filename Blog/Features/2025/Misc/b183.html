	<h4>Beyond Heretic</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Following <a href="https://quakecon.bethesda.net/en/">QuakeCon 2025</a>, Raven Software and Nightdive Studios, in collaboration with ID Studios, have shadowdropped (read: immediately released) Heretic and Hexen (plus all versions, DLC and more!) for NSW/PSN/Xbox and PC. A physical release will follow for most major platforms via <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/heretic-hexen">Limited Run</a>.</p>
	<p>Using a modified Doom engine, Raven Software's <i>Hexen</i> was a sequel to 1994's <i>Heretic</i>, a game that never made it to the N64, but fortunately, the sequel did. Bringing innovative features to the FPS genre, such as vertical aiming and an inventory system, <i>Hexen</i> was devisive with N64 fans back in 1997, averaging just 60% in reviews around the time.</p>

	<p>The original 1995 game was released on the N64 in 1997 but met the bulk of its criticism regarding the age of the game, framerate and controls; however, this will not be an issue in 2025 because with 60 FPS, 1080p up to 120 FPS and 4K depending on the platform, the original or remixed soundtrack ("Tome of Power" soundtrack by <a href="https://x.com/AndrewHulshult/status/1953538161495486614">Andrew Hulshult</a>), 16-player online deathmatch and cooperative, split-screen local deathmatch and coop modes, mod support (on Nintendo Switch), plus extra chapters made by ID and Nightdive, this is truly the definitive way to replay the N64 classic!</p>
