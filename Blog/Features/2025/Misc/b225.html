	<h4>Data Blast</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Recently, Hat-Loving Gamer has been putting out a string of videos relating to <i>Bomberman 64</i>, which finally suggests that some of Chris' wonderfully witty and incredible yet unplayable mods for games WILL soon be presented in playable form!</p>
	<p>The first video presented was a mini "Bomberman Direct", which displayed several interesting titles, including <i>Charbom Snap</i>, which is an upcoming video mash-up (read: unplayable) featuring <i>Pokemon Snap</i> mechanics set in the <i>Bomberman 64</i> world; <i>Super Bomberman 64</i>, a playable demake of the N64 game in SNES form; and <i>Bomberman Hero: Battle Arena</i>, a PC-based splitscreen multiplayer game based on the heavily-criticised single-player-only game. Hopefully, a demo for this game should release in December.</p>

	<p>Amongst other incredible mods on display, such as <i><a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/604774">Bomberman 64: Custom Adventure</a></i> by <a href="https://x.com/Litronom">Litronom</a>, which allows you to wear custom parts in adventure mode and works perfectly on real hardware, <i>Bomberman 64: Online</i> by Spekks, a 6-player online battle game for PC players, and <i>Bomberman 64: Deluxe</i>, which was showcased as a PC remake of Bomberman 64, featuring lots of extras, including new outfits, cooperative modes, and brand-spanking new worlds!</p>
	<p>All in all, there are some incredible mods coming for fans of the blast-tastic series, but an HD remake of Bomberman 64 is certainly something to look forward to, so check out the latest video of its progress below:</p>

	<h4>Decomp Destruction</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>What hasn't been discussed is whether or not some of these mods use any decompiled code or if they're hacking the ROM itself using hex editors and custom tools to modify and add to the existing game.</p>
	<p>Most public <a href="https://github.com/Bomberhackers/bmhero">decompilation efforts</a> sit at <a href="https://github.com/MarioMaster96/bomberman-64">unknown progress levels</a>, and while some haven't been updated for 5 years, others have already shown signs of being actively developed, with <a href="https://github.com/Bomberhackers">Bombhackers GitHub</a> notably displaying work in progress over the last couple of months!</p>
	<p>This isn't to imply that others haven't been working on this in private, nor that they haven't already completed some level of workable decompilation to at least make mods and more. I can only assume that a few of these utilise decompiled code based on the level of parity between the original games and their upcoming expanded PC counterparts.</p>
