	<h4>So Close Yet So Far</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Nightdive Studio's KEX engine has been powering through remasters over the past decade, gifting us <i>Turok Dinosaur Hunter</i> (2015), <i>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</i> (2017), <i>Forsaken</i> (2018), <i>Doom 64</i> (2020), <i>Shadown Man</i> & <i>Quake</i> (2021), and most recently <i>Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion</i> & </i>Quake II</i> (2023).</p>
	<p>In 2022, Nightdive CEO Stephen Kick stated on Twitter:</p>
	<div class="container">
	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>We @NightdiveStudio came *this* close to doing this, but ultimately I'm thrilled to see GoldenEye returning to modern platforms and more thrilled that @RareLtd is the studio to bring it back</p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
	</div>
	<p>It resurfaced a few days ago that Nightdive could have had the opportunity to remaster one of the most iconic games on the Nintendo 64, <i>GoldenEye 007</i>, but it wasn't to be, save for a single reason: Nintendo.</p>
	<p>Kick was recently interviewed by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/we-never-give-up-remaster-kings-nightdive-on-saving-gamings-past/">VGC</a>, where he expanded on that original tweet. Within that exchange, there were several interesting points raised regarding the circumstances surrounding what happened to the remaster, at least for the Nintendo Switch version. Nintendo ultimately felt unwilling to partner with a third-party company, and though groundwork was already done, no deals could be finalised on the Nintendo Switch due to what appears to be the greed of the Kyoto-based company.</p>
	<div class="container">
	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>Oh, yeah. Yeah. That was a real heartbreak, just because we had put in a lot of effort into pitching that. <b>We had a dream team all set up, and we got by the MGM/Eon side of things</b>. That took a year. And then it was: “Ok, we’re ready to go.” “Well, did you guys get the rights from Nintendo?” “Wait a minute, we thought you had that.” And then Nintendo was like, <b>“yeah, no third party’s ever going to touch any Nintendo stuff, ever”</b>.</p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
	</div>
	<p>Nintendo ultimately went on to completely fumble the Nintendo Switch version of <i>GoldenEye 007</i> in January 2023 on their NSO + Expansion Pak service, to much confusion. The version presented was essentially a poorly emulated effigy of the original, so much so that it presented bugs, input lag and framerate issues not present in the original 1997 release.</p>
	<p>The Xbox version, handled by Code Mystics, was produced equally poorly, and though it touted 4K resolutions, achievements, and enhanced controls, it did not offer online multiplayer, only offline splitscreen, due, again, to licensing issues with Nintendo.</p>
	<p>The fact that neither "remaster" for Switch nor Xbox involved the original developers was also criminal, especially after recalling Steven Kick's 2022 tweet. Having the knowledge and expertise of Rare veterans would have seen the projects better themselves, without a shadow of a doubt. Instead, we got a sterile release that no one is talking about positively two years later, whereas the original is still played competitively and for nostalgia some 28 years after release.</p>
	<p>Notably, neither have addressed any issues, nor have they seen fit to release QOL patches to fix the problems that plague them. The result is an underwhelming and pointless release of a classic game due to how lacklustrely they were treated. The original game released by Rare on the N64 never saw a ROM revision after launch.</p>

	<h4>Masters of the Remaster</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Had Nightdive Studios been given the opportunity to remaster <i>GoldenEye 007</i>, we would have possibly had the best version of the game publicly available. Every N64 game they have remastered has been a rock-solid release and has been followed up with improvement patches that have added better framerates and latest-gen native ports.</p>
	<p>Xbox somehow handed their "remaster" to Code Mystics, instead of using the unreleased 2007/2008 remaster that was crafted by Rare for Xbox 360s XBLA and leaked publicly in 2021. Though this version was not allowed to be released due to licensing issues at the time, had they held onto it and given it some thought, this was clearly a far superior version to what Code Mystics released and only serves to punish fans further with how good they could have been eating versus the utter slop they were served in 2023.</p>
	<p>Having replayed <i>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</i> and <i>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</i> recently on PS5, I can wholeheartedly say that this is a devastating blow to fans of the N64 classic. We can only hope that one day the opportunity comes around again and companies aren't so greedy as to deface the game for a second time.</p>
	<p>In reality, MGM owns all the rights to the James Bond IP, so what was stopping them from bypassing Nintendo and going to any other third party in the first place? It feels like a succession of poor decisions were made, Nintendo was wrongly trusted with it on NSO, and ultimately the fans are the ones losing out on what should have been a phenomenal resurgence for <i>GoldenEye 007</i>, propelling it even further into the annals of time.</p>
