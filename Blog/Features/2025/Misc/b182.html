	<p>No your eyes don't deceive you; Fox McCloud and the cast of furry stars from Star Fox 64 are heading to the Sega Dreamcast, courtesy of Jnmartin!</p>
	<p>With just two days of work, and his collective knowledge behind him from previous N64 projects, he has managed to put together something extremely impressive and no doubt giving Dreamcast owners high hopes for more quality N64 ports going forward.</p>

	<p>With Mario Kart 64</i> barely out the door (there are a couple of effects bugs to fix), the porters have whipped up a demo that has all the basics in place; it just needs a good polish when it comes to effects and texturing.</p>
	<p>For an early demo, it's astounding and makes me wonder how quickly we might see other decompiled games like <i>Perfect Dark</i> and <i>Zelda</i> hit the Dreamcast.</p>
