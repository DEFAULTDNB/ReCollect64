	<h4>Cultivating Code</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Decompilation projects for our beloved Nintendo 64 games have been coming thick and fast this year, and this latest release proves that this already phenomenal year for Nintendo 64 fans isn't quite over yet, as the github repository known as Harvestwhisperer has yielded some last-minute 2025 goodies!</p>
	<p><i>Harvest Moon 64</i>, also known as <i>Bokujo Monogatari 2</i> in Japan, has today had its USA ROM 100% decompiled down to its raw source code, which means that the original cosy farming sim from 1999 can now be thoroughly modified and examined by interested parties, who could even begin to produce native ports for alternative platforms with the files.</p>

	<p><b>North America</b></p>
	<p>The US version is now 100% decompiled! This includes all game functions, data and rodata within the game's main "text" section, and all library functions.</p>
	<p>Beyond C functions, the game now builds decompiled dialogue and cutscene bytecode segments and a subset of compiled English texts able to be parsed by the current tooling. To achieve this, the default Make target takes the list of DECOMPILED_CUTSCENES/DECOMPILED_DIALOGUES and transpiles the decompiled bytecode DSL files in the src/bytecode directory to assembly, assembles them into objects, and then includes these files in the final build by patching the linker script to include the newly assembled objects instead of the default extracted bin objects generated by Splat. Text segments that can be successfully recompiled are defined in DECOMPILED_TEXTS and automatically extracted into the assets/text directory, converted, and added to the final build under the hood.

	<p>The repository now has initial support for Japanese-version builds.</p>

	<h4>Farming For Fame</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>Harvest Moon</i> has always been an enduring series of games and to date, there are over 60 entries (including spin-offs) associated with the title. These games span across handhelds from the Game Boy through to the Switch and home consoles from the Nintendo 64 to the PlayStation 4, let alone mobile and PC games. The first entry was released in 1996 on the SNES, and the most recent ones, <i>Harvest Moon: Home Sweet Home Special Edition</i> and <i>Harvest Moon: The Lost Valley & Skytree Village Cozy Bundle</i>, were released earlier this year, meaning that if you averaged them out, a new game, remake, compilation or spin-off would have been released every six months in the last 29 years. For perspective, this decompilation project alone has taken around 28 months to complete, with the initial commit made on August 20th, 2023.</p>
	<p>Thanks to the efforts of harvestwhisperer, tfatocat, and cblck, the simulation should see renewed interest from modders and hobbyists who wish to learn from the codebase, produce cheats or mods, enhance emulation, and implement new features like high FPS, widescreen support, or modern controls, for example.</p>
