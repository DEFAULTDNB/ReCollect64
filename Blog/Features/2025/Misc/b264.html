It all goes down again in February.

	<h4>A View to Several Kills</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Last year's tournament was an absolute nail-biter, with all 22 players battling it out through qualifying group stages, then into a series of best-of-three and best-of-five matches, before meeting up as the best of the best, which would eventually determine the finalists.</p>
	<p>The LTK Cup V provided us with over 1350 kills throughout the tournament, which ultimately led to Graslu00 triumphing in first place, TH126 coming second, Grim clutching third place, and EternallyAries taking fourth. Graslu00 famously considered retiring from these tournaments following his "three-peat" victory in three consecutive tournaments (III, IV and V) in order to focus on fresh endeavours.</p>

		<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">With this achievement, I&#39;m considering my retirement from multiplayer competitions... Even if I do that, I&#39;d still play and maybe even join tournaments but with a different mindset. Focus on having fun rather than just winning.<br><br>I wanted three wins in a row and I got them.<br><br>2/5</p>&mdash; Graslu00 (@Graslu00) <a href="https://twitter.com/Graslu00/status/1906150015434649976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
