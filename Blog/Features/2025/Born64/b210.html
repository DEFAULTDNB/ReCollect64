	<h4>Born Supremacy</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Recently, I have noticed a surge of indie titles, made exclusively for PC, that are heavily influenced by the synchronising nuances that culminate in what we lovingly call Nintendo 64 games. One such Unreal Engine 5-powered title that captivated my eye is Born64, a graphically fresh-yet-familiar action-adventure title. It begins with a slayer, the main protagonist, who is sent to a village called San Andrés by the Hunters Association. Here, strange events are unfolding. Villagers are being transformed into demonic creatures, and it's up to you to uncover the truth behind the curse!</p>

	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>Born64 is an action-adventure video game inspired by the nostalgic 90's 64-bit era. Its charming graphics and mechanics make it appealing to players, not just visually, but through its rich world filled with puzzles and dungeons waiting to be explored and conquered.</p>
	<p>Technically, Born64 is designed with the limitations of the Nintendo 64 console in mind, respecting polygon counts and texture sizes for each model. Gameplay is being carefully crafted so that when players take control, every mechanic feels responsive and user-friendly while still being challenging.</p>
	<p>Currently, I’m solo-dev, and I will to launch an Early Access version on Steam to help cover development costs and gather feedback from the community. Some supporters have already made donations, which I deeply appreciate.</p>

	<h4>Born to be Wild</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>After around 4 months of public work on this project, the most up-to-date build of <i>Born64</i> contains a slew of mechanics such as the hookshot, shooting, swordplay, jumping and swimming, but the developer has plenty more planned, though unfortunately, there are currently no plans to get this up and running on native N64 hardware just yet.</p>
	<p>The game contains a plethora of locations with a sensibility towards the look and feel of traditional N64 games, and as such, you can expect dense foggy expanses, atmospherically lit dungeons and twisty catacombs, as well as a world filled with interesting NPCs, mysteries to uncover, demons to slay, and wondrously creepy locations to explore.</p>
	<p>If you would like to help with the success of this already brilliant-looking title, then please give the developer a follow and watch out for the early access version to give them constructive input as well as the drive to make this gorgeously low-poly love letter to the N64 flourish!</p>
