	<h4>Kong-pletely Different</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Did you know that when Rare began to focus on the N64, Diddy was not always set to be the star of Diddy Kong Racing, or that racing wasn't even the originally intended genre of the game?</p>
	<p>Many people know that Rare's initial foray into true racing games was with <i>R.C. Pro-AM</i> on the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988 and that Diddy Kong Racing began life around 1996 as a Pro-A.M. title, tentatively known as "RC Pro-A.M. 64". But let's go back even further.</p>
	<p>Following the release of <i>Killer Instinct 2</i> in arcades (cancelled on the SNES), Rare split in two to craft a home version, known now as <i>Killer Instinct Gold</i>, and another game for the 64-bit console. The second game was pencilled in to be a real-time strategy game with time travel mechanics and cavemen protagonists, but within a month it was changed out to become a racing title because the team felt it was far more appealing. They were right.</p>
	<p>The shift to racing prompted a change in direction for the characters too. The name it adopted, "Wild Cartoon Kingdom", suggests that it would drop a realistic direction and head towards animated characters and a theme park vibe that would appeal to the younger generations. The next name change brought the title far closer to its final form. "Adventure Racers" was now the working title; the intention to link it to Rare's earlier racing titles became clearer and the ability to adventure rather as well as race was plainly outlined.</p>
	<p>Very few images exist for Wild Cartoon Kingdom, but you can see from this character panel that the foundations were being laid for Diddy Kong Racing:</p>

	<p>The only known image from "Pro-AM 64" is this image of Timber in his plane. This emblem also appeared on an extremely rare promotional polo shirt owned by Martin Wakeley.</p>

	<h4>Timber-iffic</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Rare created Diddy Kong in 1993 as a redesign of DK Junior; however, Nintendo didn't like it and asked Rare artist Kev Bayliss (aka Diddy Kong's dad) to repurpose the design as a separate character to join the Kong family.</p>	
	<p>Following the success of the <i>Donkey Kong Country</i> games, Shigeru Miyamoto was the one to suggest that Rare use the chimp as the titular character, instead of the lovable tiger, Timber.</p>
	<p>Note the order of characters during the introduction of the game. Timber features first, a definite nod to his original status within the game's tangled DNA. Drumstick is also given away as a playable character halfway through the opening introduction, which is interesting because it is not a particularly quick process to unlock him. You have to win all four GP trophies and run over the frog with a rooster's comb.</p>
	<p>Did you also notice that the hub world in <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i> is known as Timber's Island? Owned by Timber's parents, it is a land protected by Taj and desired for takeover by the dastardly Wizpig. This is a relic of the original Pro-AM 64 game where Timber's parents, the King and Queen of the island, were </p>
	<p>The layout for the hub world also changed dramatically, with extra areas for Dino Domain and the entrance to the left of Wizpig's stone-carved face. In the German promotional video below, you can see the route taken around the island has a slightly longer series of destinations than in the final game. The changes must have been made to segregate the map into distinct zones, and having icy biomes on both sides of the map would have been confusing for players to remember which way to travel to get to each level.</p>
	<p>As the final map virtually uses cardinal directions, it's simpler to navigate. You will also note the inclusion of collectible Rare coins instead of red N64 flags or silver coins. The build version in the video is noted as "Version 1,964", which I find a wonderfully fitting series of numbers to be used in the demonstration.</p>
	<p>The final game came in two versions, V1.0 and V1.1. The latter contained graphical fixes, small playability updates such as removing the missiles in Space Port Alpha, and rectifying a warp glitch that speedrunners could abuse to beat the game in under 60 minutes.</p>
	<p>Interestingly, the PAL version of the ROM used a slightly better 320x261 resolution compared to the NTSC version's 320x237 pixels. There is no explicit reason for this change, but it's noteworthy.</p>

	<h4>Kong-tinue?</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>There were a number of planned sequels to <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i>; the main two were <i>Donkey Kong Racing</i> for the GameCube and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6CVcxAjPRk">Diddy Kong Pilot</a> for the Game Boy Advance. While <i>Diddy Kong Pilot</i> shared a lot of similarities to <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i>, it was eventually repurposed into <i>Banjo-Pilot</i> for GBA in 2005. Interestingly, the beta for <i>Banjo-Pilot</i> used a voxel engine on the GBA, a method of using 3D graphics on the 2D system, though the final game reverted to a 2D rendering method due to the voxel system causing too much lag for the handheld once populated with characters and items.</p>
	<p><i>Donkey Kong Racing</i> was planned to be Rare's way of bringing their racing prowess to the next generation of games consoles, but instead of individuals, it would be a herd racing jungle romp. Following their switch from Nintendo to MS in 2002, the game was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtOWzNaGkNs">ported from GameCube to Xbox</a> but was then swiftly retitled to "Sabreman Stampede" due to Nintendo holding the rights to Donkey Kong when they were bought by MS. The game never released, and the OG Xbox title was officially declared dead in 2008, citing that the game wasn't up to Microsoft's next-gen expectations, and without the Kongs, it lacked direction. Sabreman was a character from Rare, then known as Ultimate Play the Game's 1984 game <i>Sabre Wulf</i>. The name of which went on to become Konrad von Sabrewulf in the fighting game series <i>Killer Instinct</i>.</p></p>
	<p>Before being entirely scrapped, it was also ported to the Xenon hardware, known as the 360, and portions of the ideas were used to form <i>Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts</i>, a game that fans of the bear and bird would question for years to come because it deviated so far from the platforming formula everyone knew and loved.</p>
	<p>Each character in Diddy Kong Racing was also set to have their own game proceeding DKR, with Rare setting up a rag-tag bunch of diverse faces to lead their own games. Banjo and Conker got theirs, but Timber, already sidelined as the star of Diddy Kong Racing, along with the rest of the cast, never got their chance to take the lead.</p>
	<p>"Timber 64" would have featured the British Tiger cub in his first solo adventure, but that wasn't to be. With Rare being extremely secretive, even across departments and teams, half of the former staff at Rare acknowledge that the game even existed, while the other half recall seeing a working demo. Interestingly, Timber was also set to head Rare's "Zelda Killer" <i>Dinosaur Planet</i> for the N64.</p>
	<p>Prior to Fox McCloud and the Star Fox team fronting <i>Star Fox Adventures</i> when it released on the GameCube in 2002, Sabre (another reference to Sabrewulf)and Krystal had already been pushed aside and rebranded as a <i>Star Fox</i> game by Nintendo. With Timber supposedly being the main protagonist of the original draft of <i>Dinosaur Planet</i>, it makes me wonder if "Timber 64" was actually a precursory prototype for <i>Dinosaur Planet</i>.</p>
	<p>Timber would use all four legs for speed, his claws for climbing, and his trusty satchel for items and collectables found in the prehistoric world, and he would have a small dinosaur sidekick too. Again, there is very little artwork for this iteration of the game, but Kev Bayliss once posted the image below, citing that the game was playable, but development refocused to DKR, and that was essentially the end of Timber's career.</p>

	<p>Drumstick and T.T. (Tick Tock) were characters who are canonically the original defenders/inhabitants of Timber's Island. Drumstick fought Wizpig first, prior to Diddy and the crew's involvement, and T.T. guides you around the levels. Both have the best stats in the game, making them the best characters to never return to another game outside of the DKR universe.</p>
	<p>Pipsy the Mouse was the first and only female Diddy Kong Racing character. Kazooie was not in the game and was not hiding in Banjo's backpack, as many schoolyard rumours had perpetuated. Tiptup the Turtle had a bit part in <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> and again in <i>Banjo-Tooie</i>, but nothing again since. Bumper the Badger was humorously written off by the Rare staff in 2012 as serving time in prison. Rare employee Leigh Loveday was quoted as saying "Bumper has been out of jail for some time now and he is sorry for everything he did". Krunch, known as Krash in the German beta, was a Kremling Kritter who I always thought bore more than a slight resemblance to Vector the Crocodile from the <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> universe, namely <i>Knuckles Chaotix</i> from 1995. Like the other characters, he would only ever appear again in <i>Diddy Kong Racing DS</i> in 2007.</p>
	<p>As with many things at Rare, the ideas overflowed and many starting points were laid out, but sadly, very few actually came to full fruition. Notable teasers include the six coloured eggs and the Ice Key from <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i>, which would link to <i>Donkey Kong 64</i>'s Crystal Caves, the Golden DK Statue and the mysterious pillar in <i>Donkey Kong 64</i>. There was also an ice key and three cryptic eggs in <i>Banjo-Tooie</i>, but due to ditching their "Stop'N'Swap" idea, they unlocked features within the game itself.</p>
	<p>Unlike BK and DK64, <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i> had no links to the cancelled Stop 'N' Swap feature because it was created prior to Banjo-Kazooie, though many people misremember there being a connection to DKR and somehow forget about DK64's altogether.</p>
	<p>With each decompilation, even more details emerge about our favourite N64 games through the fabric of their very code. DKR is currently at 75% complete and is already throwing up fantastic findings, such as beta animations, <a href="https://github.com/FazanaJ/Diddy-Kong-Racing/releases/tag/1.0">uncapped frame rates</a> on retail consoles through use of the expansion pak, <a href="https://acastelli.com/dkr/">randomisers</a>, and more.</p>
	<p>I cant wait to see what's found next!</p>
