	<h4>Never Enough</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Expert GoldenEye modder Wreck, aka <a href="https://x.com/GoldeneyeMods">GoldenEyeMods</a>, has been busily beavering away on something quite special for the <i>GoldenEye 007</i> and <i>007 The World is Not Enough</i> fans. <i>GoldenEye 007 Tournament Edition</i> is a massively overhauled ROM hack for GE007 that swaps out all the multiplayer maps in favour of multiplayer arenas from 007 TWINE!</p>
	<p>Currently, the mod, which has not been made public and is undergoing a beta testing phase, contains Merchant, Istanbul, Field of Fire, Volcano, Silo Surprise, Submarine, Flashpoint, MI-6 HQ, Castle Thane, and Labyrinth levels. Each of these maps has been masterfully exported from TWINE and imported into the GoldenEye engine, then given collision, weapon placement, and spawn locations, as well as other far more technical things.</p>

	<p><a href="https://x.com/THOneTwoSix">TH126</a> and <a href="https://x.com/AdzyIn3D">AdzyIn3D</a> gave this a session through netplay this morning, with randomised weapons and paintball mode enabled. You can check out that test session demonstrating each of the 10 maps here:</p>

	<h4>Tournament Treats</h4>

	<p>When the release of this ROM hack comes to pass, I have no doubts that competitive players will gather together from around the world and rinse this for all it's worth on netplay. I noticed in the above video that the character list has the four legendary bonds added back in and alternate costumes for several characters, and there was also a "Pistols Plus" setting in the weapons options, so there will be a variety of fun loadouts to configure to keep the game fresh and inviting for a long while once it's made public.</p>
	<p>Wreck's other projects include the ongoing modification <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r37"><i>GoldenEye X</i></a>, a port of the <i>GoldenEye</i> levels, weapons and characters into <i>Perfect Dark</i>'s updated engine. It's interesting that the levels for TWINE haven't made it into a <i>Perfect Dark</i> ROM hack yet; perhaps once <i>GE:X</i> is more complete, that might happen as a separate project after? Who knows!</p>
	<p>As always, I will be keeping my ear to the ground for updates on this one, because as with everything Wreck turns his hand to, you know this is going to be amazing to play.</p>
