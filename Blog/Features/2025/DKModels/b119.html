	<p>Donkey Kong has long been a fan-favourite. Since his first appearance in 1981 as the bad guy, Nintendo has transformed the beast into a loveable hero, and their latest game, <i>Donkey Kong: Bananza</i>, is set to give the great ape his first truly three-dimensional outing since he starred in <i>Donkey Kong 64</i> in 1999.</p>

	<p><i>Donkey Kong 64</i>'s model is by far the best-looking model given to us on the Nintendo 64. With 704 tris, this version of the titular monkey has everything going for him: dashing good looks, an expressive face, and a soft-looking fur that does a lot with very little detailing.</p>
	<p>Other than articulation for swinging, jumping, swimming and the sort, there wasn't much external modelling required other than shaping that iconic silhouette and giving him an instantly recognisable ambling motion to his movements.</p>

	<p>After the gorgeous DK64 model provided by Rare, <i>Mario Tennis</i> and, unbelievably, <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> presented the highest detailed models, with 553 for <i>Mario Tennis</i> and 520 in <i>Super Smash Bros</i> respectively. Donkey Kong's aesthetic in <i>Mario Tennis</i> echoes that of the stylish simian's <i>DK64</i> likeness, minus the open mouth, so devloper Camelot, definitely paid homage to the overall look and feel of the character after his initial outing in 1999.</p>
	<p>Weirdly, the <i>SSB</i> model contains the third highest number of tris, only to look the most derpy of the entire list. I'm not sure how this went so wrong or how it uses so many tris when it looks this simplistic, but the biggest mistake was that incredibly malformed noggin. Notably, his portrait in the character select screen looks decent, but the model, oh my lawd, it's bad!</p>
	<p>As we established in the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b88">Mario's Models article</a>, every character's model had to be built as streamlined as possible for performance reasons, but how does it look so bad, even compared to known character art at the time? The articulation in the limbs is good, and the hands, feet and trademark red tie are there, but the face and head are shaped terribly, specifically his jawline and front profile.</p>
	<p>When Rare released <i>DK64</i> in November 1999, it was Rare's artists who gave him the trademark looks, but when <i>SSB</i> was released 10 months earlier, it was HAL Laboratory, Inc.'s artists who modelled the great ape after Rare's previous Donkey Kong Country games on the SNES. While on paper they share similarities, the artistry was not shared across the games, and so sadly, <i>SSB</i>'s DK looks like he's been forced through a concrete mixer, backwards.</p>

	<p>Camelot's <i>Mario Golf</i> released just a month before <i>Mario Tennis</i> did; it looks like they had slightly less headroom on the ROM, with just 478 tris making up DK, as opposed to the 553 triangle allowance used in <i>Mario Tennis</i>. Though you can see the more boxy-looking arms and scrimped details around his cuffs, they did a good job at retaining a more visually appealing effigy of DK than Nintendo could in <i>SSB</i>; at least his head is the right shape!</p>
	<p>The first <i>Mario Party</i> game, by Hudson, utilised just 439 tris in their DK model. As a result, he has a less upright look about him and a more cube-like overall shape, which I guess lends itself better to him bolting around a board game on all fours rather than performing dextrous competitive tasks with sports equipment in hand. I'm not a huge fan of the stance they gave him, but incredibly, <i>Mario Party 2</i>'s and even 3's DK models definitely look worse than in this first outing.</p>
	<p>The texturing is another key change for DK. Hudson has attempted to use a stylised, textured fur; however, I think it looks heinous. The best approach is to use lighting to give his facet-painted polygons shape and texture; there was no need to try to give him 50 billion hairs. Perhaps they were aiming for something in the middle of HAL's <i>SSB</i> texture with the furtive gait in having him primarily on all fours. Given the timeline, it's more likely that HAL copied the texturing (and did it better), which was about the only thing they did better, in my honest opinion.</p>

	<p>Talk about a downgrade. DK went from 439 tris in <i>Mario Party</i> down to just 411 in <i>Mario Party 2 & 3</i>. I assume the increased number of boards, minigames, and effects used in the latter titles meant that sacrifices had to be made with DK's mesh; however, I think the aesthetic is extremely similar, and at least by the year 2001, in <i>Mario Party 3</i>, they were able to give him a more upright posture.</p>
	<p>It's weird to think that DK started out as a bad guy based on King Kong, who was then given a fresh lease of life by Rare and redesigned for the <i>Donkey Kong Country</i> series of games and has ultimately come back full circle into Nintendo's hands again following both Rare becoming a part of Microsoft's studios in 2002 and then the success of <i>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</i> (2023) elevating DK back into the limelight with a phenomenal role and Seth Rogan comically voicing him.</p>

	<p>The model from <i>Donkey Kong: Bananza</i> will be the highest detailed model of the great ape to date. This Donkey Kong model will undoubtedly have more tris than all the others put together, and for comparison, Mario's model in <i>Super Mario 64</i> had 760 tris, but by his last outing in <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i>, the plumber was touting a ridiculous 37,800 triangles, an increase of 49.7 times the triangle density! With this in mind I would predict that DK will have around 35,000 triangles, perhaps more, given that the time period between <i>SMO</i> and <i>DKB</i> is 8 years, and the power of the Nintendo Switch 2 should be able to handle more than the original Switch could in terms of pushing polygons, or triangles, around the screen in 3D.</p>
