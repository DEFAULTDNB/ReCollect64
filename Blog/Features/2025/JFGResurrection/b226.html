	<h4>Jet Force Germany</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>About two weeks ago I stumbled across something quite cool entirely by accident. <i>Jet Force Gemini: Resurrection</i> is a passion project being undertaken by two German fans of Rare's action-adventure third-person shooter.</p>
	<p>Marius Richter and Jan Schoofs began the project around February 2012, fleshing out concept art and beginning to put together something recognisable in Unity 3D. Here is the day one quote from the blog along with a selection of notable images (Unity 3D top, UE5 bottom):</p>

	<p>Jet Force Gemini Resurrection is a non-commercial fan project made by two german guys, Marius Richter and Jan Schoofs. All aspects of the game have been made by us.</p>
	<p>Marius Richter being in charge of scripting, 3D modeling, level design, AI programming, background story and sounds, Jan Schoofs taking care of the overall visuals, concept art, character design, weapons design and texturing.</p>
	<p>We are currently uploading our first ingame trailer, which shortly reminds you of the original game and its story by showing original game footage. At about 2:00 you can actually see what we have created so far.</p>
	<p>All this stuff has been made with the Unity3D Game Creation tool which can be looked up at www.unity3d.com. Thank you guys for such an amazing piece of software. You made our dream come true. We have to admit - anyone of us had an idea HOW to make a video game and we got stuck several times. But due to this amazing software, a lot of endurance and also an enormous learning curve, we were able to achieve this amazing results. Since this is the work of only two people, we can be proud of what we have created and we would love to see you follow this blog and this project.</p>
	<p>We will keep you up to date as soon as there are news!</p>

	<p>In 2014, the project seemingly went cold. All the YouTube video links lead to dead ends, and there has been no further communication on the dedicated blog. There wasn't even a post stating whether they were abandoning the project or migrating to another place. Since then, the project HAS still been progressing, but rather than on their blog site or YouTube, it's shifted into a Facebook group, which I found while searching for JFG box art, manuals, and other images.</p>
	<p>With artwork for a cat instead of Lupus, the dog, and a character, Nash, that does not directly resemble Juno (or Vela), I think that it's safe to assume that the pair were purposefully avoiding any potential likeness or copyright issues that might have surfaced. As mentioned in the first quote, they did produce the original assets in Unity, however, at some stage they switched to UE5, which, though it looks higher quality, honestly may have been a mistake judging by framerate issues and graphic fidelity in modern games that use this version of the engine. Regardless, the progress is still trudging on today, though the pair seem to be using AI to generate assets, or at the very least artwork, for the project.</p>
	<p>The selection of images I have archived here are purely the most vibrant or recognisable and show the current in-game HUD replica, but the Facebook group houses plenty more images of sketches and ideas, comparison shots and map layouts.</p>

	<h4>Rare Progress</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>So what is the current state of the project, and is it playable after 13 years? The exact answer is unclear, but it seems like the duo are still working on JFG: Resurrection on and off, with the latest updates being posted recently, in October 2025.</p>
	<p>This latest progress update is encouraging, but I still find it odd that no videos remain that demonstrate the project's progress so far. Perhaps they were unhappy with the results and have gone back to the drawing board? Perhaps they have changed direction? Who knows.</p>

	<p>So today I am revealing the last of the 3 main worlds for Orion. Since I wanted to create a level not being a planet or spaceship, it was necessary to come up with something else. JFG introduced Ichor Military Base being a bastion on some kind of asteroid but I did not want to copy this idea so I brainstormed and decided to set up the "Powerplant" (still to be named).</p>
	<p>Floating in space next to a star within the orbit of an nearby planet, this high-tech space station collects and stores immense amounts of energy through a large amount of solar panels. Landing on a small platform next to the structure, you'll always face the danger of losing your balance and falling into space while taking on your enemies and fighting your way up. This will be a tough one! I hope you like it!</p>

	<h4>Twinned Projects</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>While hunting for video evidence of <i>JFG: Resurrection</i>, I did manage to find a couple of other projects from different people who were also interested in remaking JFG using the Unreal engine.</p>
	<p>This example is from 2016 and was produced by a group of students from the TEC de Monterrey, campus Guadalajara, Mexico. They used UE 4.15 and the Substance 3D plugin to produce this animated proof of concept: </p>
	<p>Demonstrating a basic "remaster" concept, KÃ©vin FAURE also shared the <a href="https://jetforcegeminiremaster.wordpress.com/">project page<a/>, which gives you a little more insight into the students' project as well as a stunning comparison gallery.</p>

	<p>Lastly of all, I found a more basic but equally intriguing project which uses ESRGAN AI upscaling to produce high-resolution textures for the existing ROM. Using a compatible emulator, you can simply drop in the texture packs and play the game at a notably sharp picture quality, with the enhanced textures making the game look far less fuzzy and undeniably crisp.</p>
	<p>Interestingly, 5 years ago Gaming Revived previewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbfwQwModb-eb7ZMTaqU7ni62imMqheR8">lots of games that had ESRGAN texture pack previews</a>, though sadly I couldn't locate any to try them for myself. The ethos of the posts here is that you could dump all textures, run them through an AI upscaler and produce these effects for yourself.</p>
	<center>

	</center>
	<p>As a concept, this is awesome, but it would be more incredible to produce these upscaled assets on the fly, at run time in the emulator, meaning that you don't need to supply any texture packs at all; just start your game and select AI upscaling if you so choose! Imagine that!</p>
	<p>All of these projects demonstrate exciting fan service for Rare's impressive and endearing 1999 shoot 'em up. I just hope that the Resurrection project continues to bear fruit and that we get to actually see something in action, or play something of it in the not-so-distant future.</p>
