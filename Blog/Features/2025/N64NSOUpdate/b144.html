	<h4>Give and Take</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Ahead of the June 5th Nintendo Switch 2 release date, Nintendo has dropped a banger/clanger of a video that demonstrates upgrades to the N64 portion of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service.</p>
	<p>The video gives us three main features, which I will cover individually, and one final point of contention, which I'm sure you will agree is more than a little jarring.</p>

	<p>While a small filter such as this may seem insignificant, its nostalgic and authentic value is immense. The Nintendo 64 came out in a world before HDTVs and a bygone era where the TV was deeper than it was wide. CRT TVs weighed more than you would think, and the overwhelming bulkiness meant there was more chance of breaking the thing it was standing on than breaking your TV set.</p>
	<p>Regardless, because of their components and inner workings, CRT TVs had a warm, fuzzy luminance and a quality to them that simply cannot be replicated with a standard TV today. Luckily, with the latest additions to the NSO + Expansion Pack service, you get a submenu with options to add a lovely-looking CRT filter.</p>
	<p>Interestingly, the filter looks to downscale the resolution to 240p, which brings about more natural anti-aliasing and serves to add to the authentic look of the 90s visuals. It's a great addition, but could they have added more filter options? Perhaps we will see more added in the future. Who knows?</p>

	<p>Save states and save spamming are all the rage. Kids today largely don't know the agony of losing all your lives in a game and having to start again because they're born into a world of simply reloading their previous save and carrying on. Instead of save states per se, Nintendo have brought the ability to "rewind" your play into their own brand of emulation.</p>
	<p>Rewinding your game essentially involves a series of RAM snapshots (also known as suspend points) automatically taken prior to pressing the menu button. You can then select which point you wish to continue from as if you have rewound time. It's just fancy save-state switching, but it looks cool thanks to the addition of thumbnails and a wider selection of in-action points to resume from.</p>

	<p><b>FINALLY</b> Nintendo has listened and improved the janky controls within the N64 section. You can now select any button and map it to anything you like, with a full description for ease of use! This is how it should have been from the beginning, but after nearly four years, we finally got there!</p>
	<p>Prior to this you had to do weird things if you didn't own the Nintendo 64 controller for Nintendo Switch; for example, in <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i>, you had to hold down the R button to temporarily remap the X/Y/B/A buttons to the C-Buttons, an absolute travesty of an overthought control scheme which could have been simplified by allowing remapping from day one.</p>
	<p>I'm over the moon for this option because not only does it bring some customisation and personalisation to the fore, but it also gives you the full explanation of the control scheme and hints as to how to perform special moves, like having the manual. In the video example you can see that tapping ZL or R twice performs a barrel roll, which is extremely handy for new players who are trying out the classic games.</p>

	<p>In what can only be described as the ultimate anti-consumerism move, if you don't own a Nintendo Switch 2 console, you cannot enjoy the rewind or CRT filter features.</p>
	<p>Nintendo have clearly made these Switch 2 exclusive features in order to tempt you over to their new console, but in my opinion this is the most disloyal thing they could have pulled for existing enjoyers who cannot afford the upgrade yet.</p>
	<p>Let's be real: <b>you'll pay the same amount for the NSO subscription and the Expansion Pack add-on, regardless of which Switch console you own, but now OG users get less for their money</b>. How is that fair?</p>
	<p>All of these features can be produced on the OG Switch; don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Suspend points are exactly the same thing as "rewind", just dressed differently, and filters have been a thing in emulation since around <a href="https://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=50066#Post50066">2009</a> and nowadays take very little in terms of CPU/GPU resources to implement.</p>
	<p>If Nintendo do reconsider and eventually bring the same features to all users, I will be much happier, but for me this tarnishes an announcement that actually looked great on the surface.</p>
	<p>It's just Nintendo doing Nintendo things as usual, I guess.</p>
