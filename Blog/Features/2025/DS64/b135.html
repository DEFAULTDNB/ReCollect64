	<h4>Rocket Leagues Ahead</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>It's the middle of May 2025, and a brand new full 3D arcade-style sports action indie game has just arrived for the N64! Driving Strikers 64 is a port by <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b72">Spooky Iluha (also known for their incredible 2nd place winning SpaceWaves Game Jam #5 entry)</a> of the four-player Driving Strikers indie game for the Nintendo 64 using Libdragon SDK, Tiny3D and a custom-made codebase in C.</p>
	<p>The original game was released for Dreamcast and PC in 2023 by <a href="https://www.wavegamestudios.com/games/driving-strikers/">Wave Game Studios</a> and offered 4-player in-person or online multiplayer action over the internet using a modem or broadband adapter.</p>
	<p>Features:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Physics-driven gameplay using the Tiny Physics Engine open-source library
		<li>Multilanguage support with 8 different languages using .ini configs and inih open-source library
		<li>Stereo CD quality music with voiced audio on a 16MB cartridge
		<li>Full 480i TrueColor graphics at high framerates of at least 30+ FPS without an expansion pak, extremely rare in N64 titles
		<li>Quality artwork and levels with antialiasing and high-res fullcolor mipmapped textures
		<li>HDR rendering and bright lighting with autoexposure, never before seen on any N64 title
	</ul>
	<p>Update version 1.01 of the ROM makes EEPROM saves optional to improve flashcart compatibility, and a rumble-based bug was squashed.</p>

	<h4>Feature-Driven</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The physics-driven gameplay alone is astounding, but when you consider that this supports 8 languages, 480i TrueColor resolutions at 30 FPS, HDR with auto-exposure, Rumble Pak support, EEPROM saving and stereo CD-quality music with voiced audio that all fits neatly within a 16MB cartridge, you quickly realise that Reality Jump and LD2K's (Luke Benstead and David Reichelt) collaboration is something quite special.</p>
	<p>With two modes, a nostalgia-inducing soundtrack of noughties bangers, a selection of teams and a bunch of arenas to choose from, this port is as fresh as they come. Unbelievably, it does not require an expansion pak, though it is recommended to have one for the best experience possible.</p>
