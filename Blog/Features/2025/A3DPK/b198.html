	<h4>Teaser Tapes</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Eagle-eyed watchers of the Analogue website have today spotted a rather interesting update to the press kit portion of the site. The press kit essentially contains images and media that Analogue are happy to share with the world, and today's findings finally add a somewhat ethereal 30-second video into the mix, including footage of the device working!</p>
	<p>With the console still heavily delayed, N64 enthusiasts are picking at every breadcrumb they can to garner any more information from the few scant pieces of info released by Analogue. Take a look for yourself:</p>

	<h4>1080 in 4K</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Demonstrating <i>1080Â° Snowboarding</i> and a CRT filter, this video shows the cartridge being selected, plugged in, started, and the menu options being brought up, all while using the wonderful <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r69">8BitDo 64 Controller</a>.</p>
	<p>What isn't shown is any actual in-game gameplay or anything of the "3DOS", the core system the console will be running on. It's another tantalising glimpse, but again it's nothing above or beyond what we should have been privy to at the time of pre-odering the console, <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b37">back in October of 2024</a>.</p>
	<p>Notably, I spotted that the power switch resembles a bumper more than a toggle because it appears to bounce back once switched on, and that the console output is beautifully stylised with a rather authentic-looking CRT filter. Hopefully we will get to see more, including the 3DOS's features, in further updates before release!</p>
