	<p>Built in <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Engine</a>, a group of dedicated fans are working to rebuild Rare's <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> beta: Project Dreams 64!</p>
	<p>Mr Mind Splat, the main developer, has previously released a short proof of concept demo, aptly named "the exploration demo", which was made available on their Discord on April the 3rd, 2024.</p>
	<p>So far the developers have put together a basic engine that contains textures and models that strikingly resemble the early footage of the SNES RPG. The PC demo, which is not compatible with the N64 hardware as of yet, features Edson with his trusty sword in a land of trees, stonework and a couple of houses, all encapsulated by undulating water around the circumference. The striking similarities to the lost SNES build and initial images of Banjo with a sword can be found over at the <a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Project_Dream_%28lost_builds_of_cancelled_Super_Nintendo/Nintendo_64_precursor_to_%22Banjo-Kazooie%22_platformer;_1994-1997%29">Lost Media Wiki</a>.</p>

	<h4>Living the Dream</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Project Dream was originally touted by Rare for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System between 1995 and 1997. The project was reported as starring Edson, his dog Dinger, and Billy the parrot. The title would see antagonist Captain Blackeye searching for "Floaty", a substance that could make his galleon fly, but Edson got in their way, got in trouble and the rest is history.</p>
	<p>The game was ultimately scrapped due to the team feeling that it was too different from their usual projects and too ambitious for the SNES hardware. What happened next was that the engine and assets were retooled to become <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> (1998), a platformer inspired by <i>Super Mario 64</i> (1996) that helped Rare raise the bar across the Nintendo 64 system for years to come.</p>
	<p>In updated, yet unreleased works, lead developer Mr Mind Splat, along with 3D modellers Chimthasomething and Painless Chunk, have painstakingly crafted a "Blackeye" intro cutscene featuring the pirate exploring a cove with a treasure chest to loot. What is interesting about this project in particular is that very little footage exists, so everything is coming directly from the minds of the developers, with a slight hint at names, locations, and themes based on somewhat sparse articles and information of the time.</p>
