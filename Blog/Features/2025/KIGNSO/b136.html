	<p><i>Killer Instinct Gold</i> has become the 41st N64 title to hit Nintendo's Switch Online service (NSO) today, by way of their paid Expansion Pak product. The game, which originally debuted in 1997, was a console port of the arcade smash <i>Killer Instinct 2</i>, which itself was a direct sequel to <i>Killer Instinct</i> for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (1994).</p>
	<p>Featuring a total of eleven characters, <i>Killer Instinct Gold</i> added four new faces to the mix, Kim Wu, Maya, Tusk and Gargos, for you to learn thousands of new combos, breakers, and finishers. The title essentially began as an amalgamation of all the ideas that wouldn't fit into the first game.</p>

	<p>The iconic fighting game, which features 2D sprites over 3D backgrounds, met a mixed reception at launch, with players citing that while the audio and visual upgrades were nice in comparison to <i>Killer Instinct 2</i>, the 2D graphics and memory-based combo system were not on par with its peers, such as <i>Tekken 2</i> (1995) and <i>Virtua Fighter 2</i> (1994). It was also criticised for removing fan-favourite characters such as Cinder and Riptor as well as the boss, Eyedol, even though they were canonically killed off in the prequel, so the fandom for this title was quite fragile from the start.</p>

	<p>Following Microsoft's acquisition of Rare in 2002, a spiritual successor was released in 2013, which was an Xbox exclusive, but <i>KI Gold</i> eventually resurfaced as part of the <i>Rare Replay</i> compilation for Xbox One in 2015.</p>
	<p>Interestingly, the end of the above video states that the rights are held by "Xbox Game Studios, Microsoft 1996", which sounds out of place knowing that MS had nothing to do with the franchise until several years after its original release.</p>
	<p>Personally, I wasn't the biggest fan of the N64 version in comparison to the pre-console rendition. The 60 FPS backgrounds were nice, but I always felt that the 2D approach was somewhat lacking in a 64-bit world. Comparatively, I remember holidaying in France around 1996-1997 and finding the <i>KI2</i> arcade machine, only to rinse a lot of my spending money on playing through all the new characters who weren't in the SNES game I had back home.</p>
	<p>By the time I had an N64 in March 1997 and <i>KI Gold</i>'s delayed release in November 1997, the low-framerate 2D characters looked dated. I had already become hooked on a fully 3D fighter by the name of <i>Tekken 3</i> for the PlayStation, which debuted in March 1997 and had full combo and move lists built in as well as a proper Vs mode and stage select!</p>
