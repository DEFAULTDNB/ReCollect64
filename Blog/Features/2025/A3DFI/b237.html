	<h4>Better Late than Never</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As we know, the Analogue 3D has been laden with delays and hold-ups throughout its tumultuous existence, but finally, this week, people began receiving their preorders, and I was amongst them!</p>
	<p>Unboxing the well packaged parcel, you get a pretty minimal black box, but it's what's on the inside that truly counts. Within you get the console, an HDMI cable, a USB-C to USB-C cable and a USA-style mains USB plug, which I daren't use because of this one time I accidentally blew up a Dreamcast by plugging a UK mains cable into a Japanese console that I had previously won online.</p>
	<p>As well as the hardware, you get a tiny document pouch with a QR code and some "FPGA" and "Analogue" stickers. The QR code leads you to the quick start and update portions of the site, and I attempted to follow these to the letter in order to get my console up to date and ready to rock.</p>

	<h4>Mini Heart Attack(s)</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>My first hurdle was the connectivity. I (wrongly) assumed that any HDMI and USB-C power cable would work. They won't. I tried to use an 18V USB-C phone charger and it just caused the LED to flicker weirdly, so I quickly pulled the power and swapped to the Nintendo Switch 2's USB-C power brick. At last, I had a solid white LED! I then tried to use the HDMI that was plugged into my Nintendo Switch 2 as well, and it wouldn't recognise it, so I used the HDMI cable provided in the box and again: success!</p>
	<p>My second hurdle was getting the 3Dos up to date. I wanted to remove the SD card to update the system; afterall it doesn't appear to have working WI-FI built in (though it has the Wi-Fi logo carved into the shell), so this all has to be done manually. Getting the card out was quite simple; it's not spring-loaded, it's a pull-out style, but something that did shock me, and nearly caused a meltdown before breakfast, was the fact that the SD card is a big old 24mm-width custom Secure Digital card, but the length is closer to 25mm as opposed to the standard 32mm. As such, when I put it in my laptop's card reader, it sucked it in and didn't read it, and I couldn't physically get the thing out again.</p>
	<p>I'm not going to sugarcoat it; I panicked, a lot. But then I remembered that my wife had bought some brand new tweezers recently; these saved me from having a full-on heart attack. I re-checked the instructions, and there was another way of doing this, one that didn't rely on losing my brand new SD card in my daily-driver laptop. I would try this instead.</p>

	<h4>Updating and Improving</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Using the USB-A to USB-C cable from my <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r69">8BitDo 64 controller</a>, I plugged in the Analogue 3D console, gave it a couple of seconds, held reset and power for 5 seconds, and the LED lit up green. This mode allows you to copy files to and from the SD card without removing it from the console. This is 10,000% the best way of doing this for me process given the weird SD card size.</p>
	<p>Downloading the <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/3d/firmware/1.1.0">1.1.0 firmware update from here</a> and placing it on the root of the SD card, I thought that while I had access to the SD card, I would also place the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqazhITlZPV3kxQUdRNklCUDBVSDJNWDd4SWstd3xBQ3Jtc0trZS0zNmFlbS00SFp5UEZWT3Y0bE1ZbkNXanU5dDRNWU1SS1ZwS3Vvc09wNFpWMVViSHVFTEpibm5kSHllSXp0MThRdXJydE03NXpIbWx2TnIxeGZpenpYRXJDQklqcDNJZW8yVkVINXV3d2g1QVR5MA&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fretrogamecorps%2FAnalogue-3D-Images%2Freleases%2Fdownload%2Fv1.0%2Flabels.db&v=uEbMLVgaDVc">cartridge image file</a> in the <b>"SD:/Library/N64/Images"</b> folder too.</p>
	<p>Disconnecting it from my PC and connecting it back to my TV and booting it up, it auto-detects the firmware update and installs it with a yellow glowing LED on the front. The LEDs that make up the  controller port numbers glow to indicate each 25% chunk of the update that has been installed, and the flashing process takes just 5-6 minutes in total. The console was now up to date, <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b181">as was the controller</a>, and I also would have game cartridge images to spruce up the OS!</p>
	<p>Why the game cart art isn't included in either update is baffling. The file I have seen floating around evidently came from beta testers, though in the final release this step has not been explained to consumers. A very odd choice, but easy to rectify.</p>
	<p>Incidentally, a nice detail is that the LED on the front is also the Bluetooth pairing button. Pairing BT controllers is so quick and intuitive. The 8BitDo 64 controller need to also be in "D-Input" mode to function correctly with the Analogue 3D.</p>

	<h4>Quick Compatibility Tests</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Inserting carts causes the relevant game art and information to pop up once successfully read. This usually takes a split second. I tested a range of PAL, JPN and USA carts; all worked brilliantly once cleaned (you get a small edge cleaner in the box), and all gave information such as rumble compatibility, number of players, release date and even the cart revision.</p>
	<p>Trying out flash carts is, as the rumours stated online, very hit and miss. Everdrive 64 X Series do not load at all, but is recognised as a cart, it just black screens when loaded. Everdrive 64 Plus (clones) didn't read whatsoever. I'm pleased to report that the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r2">SummerCart64</a> does read, after a few inserts, and loads games, homebrew, 64DD ROMs, and ROM hacks like <i>Mario Kart 64 Amped Up</i> and <i>Smash Remix</i> perfectly.</p>
	<p>The only homebrew that didn't work in full, which is to be expected, is the <a href="https://github.com/wermipls/mimi">Mimi Controller Test ROM</a>. This works for wired OG controllers but wouldn't work for Bluetooth controllers or USB controllers. I kind of expected this due to how it reads the analogue sticks increments, but it would have been neat if it worked with all pads. Maybe a new version could be crafted to incorporate BT and wired pads?</p>
	<p>Overall I'm pleased with the device, but I want to put some time into trying out games and various display modes. After a brief period of testing, I plan to present a full review of my findings as well as a walk around the features of 3Dos.</p>
	<p>If you have any questions regarding the Analogue 3D, please feel free to DM me at any time, and I will test various things for you and answer whatever I can.</p>
