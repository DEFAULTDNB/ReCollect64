	<h4>Halloween Havoc</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>In a follow-up to <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b204">last month's teaser from Markus Kurko</a>, today he has shared a fresh trailer that gives his latest <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> ROM hack its full title, the Lair Witch Project!</p>
	<p>This modifications name immediately put me in mind of the <a href="https://www.therwp.com/">Rare Witch Project</a>, which is also a pun on the 1999 film "The Blair Witch Project". RWP is a long-running, well established fansite dedicated to games developed by Rare, particularly the Banjo-Kazooie series, and digging up any secrets and Easter eggs within them. Could this link be intentional? Who knows but Kurko!<p> 
	<p>Whereas Spiral Mountain and the Isle o' Hags are usually bright and vibrant, joyful places, this horror-themed facelift looks to turn the atmosphere on its head, introducing new demonic enemies and a blood-drenched, cadavre-lined, and freaky overhaul that would have even given Ed Gein a spine-chilling shudder. It looks absolutely nightmarish; check it out below:</p>

	<h4>Macabre Modding</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Sporting two brand new monstrous levels to explore, 16 eerie jiggies to find and more besides, this haunted mod looks to give us the chills on the spookiest day of the year.</p>
	<p>It looks like Bottles is the victim this time, and it's up to the bear and bird double act to figure out what is going on and survive long enough to save their friend!</p>
	<p>With a promise of early access to subscribers around the 25th of October and a broader release set for the 31st, Kurko plans to terrorise us all this Halloween with his twisted and fightning vision for the animal duo!</p>
	<p>Until then, head over to Kurko's social media, and get subscribed for early access! I'm a huge Halloween fan, so I cannot wait to sink my fangs into this one!</p>
