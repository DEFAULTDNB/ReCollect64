	<h4>A Speedy Decomp</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Mario Kart 64 has become the next in a series of Nintendo 64 ROMs to be fully decompiled. The progress made within the repository suggests that the USA and EUR ROMs are now 100% matching with known dumps, though there is no update on the JPN version of the game.</p>
	<p>With the game fully decompiled, it's only a matter of time until players will get the opportunity to replay the beloved childhood classic with tweaked framerates, enhanced resolutions and a modern control scheme (including gyro controls) in the not-so-distant future, thanks to <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b127">Mr Wise-Guys' recent N64 recomp framework</a>.</p>
	<p><a href="https://youtu.be/WK5VuOInqlg?t=448">Modern Vintage Gamer</a> initially attempted to build his own version of Mario Kart 64 by using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywWwUuWRgsM">Nerrel's original information</a>, the decompilation project examples and by converting the ROM into a binary *.ELF format. He manually mapped out the entry points, list of functions and OS calls to the *.TOML file required, ready to be fed into the recompilation pipeline. Notably the game had 28475 symbols, 20376 functions and an entry point marked at 0x8000450, but in order for it to be recompiled, the C code needs to be fed into a compiler such as <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio</a> and finally hooked into a renderer such as <a href="https://github.com/rt64/rt64">Dario Samo's RT64</a>.</p>
	<p>Cutting out the step of converting the code to C in the as-yet-incomplete/unreleased <a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp">N64: Recompiled</a> tools allows any decompiled project to be fed into this pipeline ready to be ported to PC or other systems. The irony is that the N64Recomp tools should allow almost instant static recompilation, whereas using the files from any existing decompilation means that years have passed and many hours of effort poured into each one since the projects were first initiated.</p>

	<h4>Slow & Steady</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Getting the project to work as a playable PC port will not be instantaneous. It might yet take weeks or months for the game to be moulded into a playable format that the developers are happy to release. Let us not forget that the speed of a project is dictated by the ability of people, or groups of people, along with their time and energy. Nothing is ever guaranteed and no developer is obligated to be release publicly.</p>
	<p>Judging by previous efforts such as <i>GoldenEye 007</i> the games code was decompiled around 5 years ago, recompilation work began publicly in <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b101">March 2025</a> by Kholdfuzion. Just <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b122">one month later, in April 2025,</a> the game was seen in a 240 FPS playable format, at least for developers, though it has not been released to the public as of yet.</p>
	<p>There is already chatter of people wanting to modify this for online play, and adding additional texture/characters as well as tracks and items. With a store like <a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/zelda-64-recompiled/">Thunderstore.io</a> linking hosted mods for recompiled projects, this could become an exciting reality.</p>
