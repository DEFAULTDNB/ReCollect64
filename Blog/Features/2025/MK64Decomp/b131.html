	<h4>A Speedy Decompilation</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The <i>Mario Kart 64</i> decompilation project has been updated this week, with progress showing that every function is now matching byte for byte. This is excellent news in terms of preservation and puts the codebase in a great place for modders to tinker with functions, better produce more elaborate ROM hacks, or even port it to alternative platforms, such as PC, in the future.</p> 
	<p>The MK64 decompilation effort is accredited to a community of 30 contributors, whose combined efforts are bringing advancements in preservation and modding. You can take a look at the progress and the accompanying contributors over on the GitHub page linked below.</p>

	<p>Modding communities such as <a href="https://overkart64.com/">Overkart 64</a> are a prime example of how <i>Mario Kart 64</i> can be overhauled with some fantastic additions, such as custom tracks and music, as well as 3D racers instead of the stock 2D characters. It will be interesting to see what other exciting features the decomp might bring!</p>
	<p>Hopefully, in the not-so-distant future, we may see ports of the 1997 racing game spring up that bring enhanced features such as widescreen support, uncapped FPS and modern controls to the fan favourite. It's just a matter of someone, or some team, picking up the project and giving it a similar treatment to <a href="https://github.com/orgs/HarbourMasters/repositories"><i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> and <i>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</i>'s phenomenal ports</a>.</p>
