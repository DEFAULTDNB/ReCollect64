	<p>With the inevitable end of summer 2025 comes autumn 2025, which ushers in chillier weather, trees shedding their leaves and an influx of the pumpkin-spiced trash they serve up at coffee places. It isn't all doom and gloom though, because <a href="https://x.com/Markus_Kurko">Markus Kurko</a> has announced today that Banjo-Kazooie Halloween 2025 is now in the works, and a playable version should be with us by the 31st of October!</p>
	<p>Providing us just one tantalising BK-themed Blair Witch-esque image and a small paragraph of information, Kurko is wisely keeping his latest creation under wraps until the trick-or-treating day is upon us:</p>

	<p>First of all, I want to thank everyone who participated in the poll, as well as everyone who supports me month after month. Without all of you, this wouldn't be possible, thanks so much!</p>
	<p>According to the results of the polls published on Patreon, YouTube, and Instagram, the vast majority wants a Halloween Mod, so your wish is my command.</p>
	<p>Development of the game has already begun, but I can't show anything yet. The idea is for the game to include two levels, with about 6/8 Jiggies each. As I mentioned before, the game will be less cartoonish and more horror-oriented, and it may even have touches of gore, so it will not be recommended for children under 16.</p>
	<p><b>The Public Version will be on October 31st, and I'd like to have the Early Access ready by the 25th, however, I can't guarantee that 100% yet.</b></p>
	<p>I'm going to have a short trailer ready with all the details by the end of September or early October.</p>
	<p>That's all for now, I hope you're as excited as I am about this small project!!</p>
	<p>Regards,</p>
	<p>Mark Kurko</p>
