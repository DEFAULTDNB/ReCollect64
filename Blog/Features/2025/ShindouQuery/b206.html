	<h4>Humble Rumble Bundle</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When the N64 was released on June 23rd, 1996, there was no such thing as a rumble pak yet. It wouldn't be until April 27th, 1997, that the jolting peripheral would be released to coincide with <i>Star Fox 64</i>, a game that came bundled with the device to ensure that players got to enjoy the game and experience the immersion exactly as the developers intended.</p>
	<p>With the advent of their vibrational add-on, Nintendo saw fit to produce two enhanced editions of games that had released prior to that of the Rumble Pak. <i>Super Mario 64</i> and <i>Wave Race 64</i> were re-released in Japan on the 18th of July 1997 with the regional-exclusive "Shindou Pak Taiou Version", or rumble-enhanced versions of the already popular titles, but why did they only stop at those two games, and why only release them in Japan?</p>
	<p>Before April 27th, 1997, Nintendo EAD had also released <i>Mario Kart 64 & Pilotwings 64</i>, two action-packed games that could clearly have benefitted from some added rumble, yet they went untouched, and the reasons for these omissions, and more, have never really been fully explored.</p>

	<h4>Shindou Success or Sanfu?</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The first point to consider is general sales figures. <i>Super Mario 64</i> sold somewhere in the region of a whopping <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/game/2278/super-mario-64/">11.91 million</a> copies worldwide in its lifetime, and <i>Wave Race 64</i> sold just 2.95 million. Comparatively, <i>Pilotwings 64</i> shifted just 1 million copies in its lifetime, possibly overshadowed by SM64 as a launch title, and stifling its own sales in the process.</p>
	<p>However, lifetime sales do not outline the success of a game at launch or during its first few months of availability. What we do know is that SM64 and WR64 both gained "Players' Choice" status with a "Million Seller" variant each in both Europe and America, so sales of those games were definitely booming on the fledgling system between 1996 and 1997.</p>
	<p><i>Pilotwings 64</i> scraped just 1 million in sales during its lifespan, but <i>Mario Kart 64</i>, on the other hand, sold an incredible 9.85 million units during its healthy reign and gained Players Choice and Million Seller editions to boot. This begs the question "Why didn't <i>Mario Kart 64</i> get to enjoy a Shindou-enhanced re-release?". Even if it was only released to a Japanese audience, surely such an iconic first-party title deserved the rumble treatment?</p>
	<p>Perhaps the key lies within the sales data for the Shindou Edition re-releases? Sadly, there are no firm numbers on the Shindou edition games, so we can only assume that these version were only re-released in Japan due to their popularity not being high enough to follow them up with localised and enhanced versions for PAL or NTSC-U markets.</p>

	<h4>Third-Party Parity</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When looking at games that could have potentially been re-released, we could also consider second- and third-party titles. Between June 1996 and April 1997, assuming that Nintendo only shared rumble functionality with other studios in their updated SDK (software development kit) after the release of <i>Star Fox 64</i> so that they would be first to market. There were a couple of games that stand out to me which could have benefitted from additional Rumble Pak support, but did their sales numbers make them worthy candidates?</p>
	<p><i>Killer Instinct Gold</i> arrived in November 1996, achieving just 0.82 million total sales. <i>Blast Corps</i>, also by Rare, released in February 1997 and sold 1 million units in its lifetime. <i>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</i> also debuted in February and sold 1.5 million units. <i>Doom 64</i> followed in March 1997 with less than 0.5 million copies sold, and finally, <i>Hexen</i> was released in May 1997 with less than 0.20 million units shipped in total sales.</p>
	<p>Let us assume that in order to be classed as a best seller and worthy of a Shindou re-release, the game must have sold over 1 million within an extremely short period of time. Alas, only <i>Turok</i> falls into that category, but like the others, it probably was not worth the financial investment of reprinting the game at that point, because it would eat into the already very marginal profits, and manufacturing cartridges was notoriously expensive (roughly $30.00) compared to CDs (Â£1.00-$5.00).</p>
	<p>Incidentally, once Nintendo shared the updated SDK, Genki/Imagineer appeared to have been first third-party studio to add rumble functionality to their games, releasing <i>MRC: Multi-Racing Championship</i> on July 18th, 1997, followed by Probe/Acclaim with <i>Extreme G</i> releasing on September 30th. After that, a lot of third-party games received support, though some developers simply chose not to include vibration features regardless. Perhaps they wouldn't pay for the updated SDK and kept producing games to the specs of the old software. Who knows?</p>

	<h4>The Decompilation Contemplation</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Recently this whole thing got me thinking, and in a world full of decompilations, why couldn't some brave soul take on the challenge and add back in rumble support?</p>
	<p>Litronom didn't seem too enthused with the idea, but that makes sense because the entire <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b178">Amped Up</a> hack he produces has nothing to do with the decompilation. However, tagging in Kaze actually garnered a response, one that adds a lot more credence to my musings, and with that, the idea has been successfully seeded into the Interconnected Network's ether.</p>

The way rumble works in sm64 is that it&#39;s a seperate thread and the gameplay thread sends rumble signals to it.

	</center>
	<p>Hopefully chatter that sparks ideas and articles like this one might spur someone to pick up on this and add rumble to more titles. Considering that only 23 games were released prior to the Rumble Pak's launch and that around 213 games supported it in total (including <i>Star Fox 64</i>, <i>Super Mario 64</i> and <i>Wave Race 64</i> re-releases), that means that there are an estimated 173 games that might have the potential to have the functionality added in, but only if they're decompiled to a workable state in the future.</p>
