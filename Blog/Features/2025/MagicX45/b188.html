	<p>MagicX recently stepped into the limelight with its Zero 40, the innovative handheld that redesigns the Nintendo DS form factor into something akin to a micro-2DS with a portrait screen for emulating DS games more authentically, and all within a reasonably priced Â£69.99 machine.</p>
	<p>Over on their official Discord server, MagicX pinged a stage 1 device alert under product announcements, which indicates that the company is targeting the Nintendo 64 as their next unique selling point.</p>

	<p>The preproduction images for the first of its kind dedicated N64 device, which are probably far from final, can be seen below; hopefully they will go with Funtastic-style clear colour shells for the final look!</p>

	<h4>Portable Power</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The device touts emulation (Note: this is not an FPGA solution) for a range of six-button-compatible devices, but the two that stand out are "SS", or Sega Saturn, and obviously, Nintendo 64. Whether the device will truly be powerful enough to run Sega Saturn competently, as well as grant users a 1:1 N64 experience on the move, through emulation alone, remains to be seen, because emulation for either console is still tricky, even in 2025. This mainly depends on the devices' overheads, how much RAM and CPU/GPU horsepower the provided SoC might pack.</p>
	<p>The main pros of reviews I have read concerning the MagicX Zero 40 are that it is comfortable to use and leans into its niches and runs with them, rather than trying to be an all-in-one device that can do everything. However, the cons I noted were that the D-Pad is awful, screen size, colour, and saturation are incorrect (cheap screen component), and per-game emulation can be patchy when it comes to accuracy and framerates.</p>
	<p>Using the DraStic emulator on an Allwinner Cortex SoC, the MagicX Zero 40 does a decent job and provides a reasonable bang-for-buck ratio, but avid fans looking for a more authentic experience, with full-size screens and solid performance, a budget Android solution probably isn't what you want. I also don't believe that the Allwinner A133P with 2GB RAM will suffice for N64 or Saturn, so it will be interesting to see what SoC they will choose to deploy.</p>
	<p>I will be closely monitoring this device's development, with the hope that MagicX will incorporate the feedback from the Zero 40 to create something truly exceptional.</p>
