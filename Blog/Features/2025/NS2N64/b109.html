	<p>With Nintendo's recent announcement regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware, a couple of interesting pieces of information have come to light surrounding the Nintendo Switch online emulation, and more specifically, for Nintendo 64.</p>
	<p>According to a well-tucked away snippet on their site, Nintendo 64 emulation is set to see new CRT filters, rewind features, and per-game button remapping!</p>
	<p>While the handful of features are a much welcomed addition to the service, the wording suggests that it may only be privy to those with a Nintendo Switch 2 and not for those rocking the OG LED/OLED or Lite hardware.</p>

	<p>Nintendo has historically used several N64 emulators throughout their lineage of systems. Not including the GameCube's <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Master Quest</i> disc, the first officially emulated N64 games landed on the Wii Virtual Console in 2007, after the service's 2006 launch, to generally positive critique. However, 2012's Wii U's Virtual Console service utilised iQue's "Vessel" as the proprietary emulator, and due to its overly dark default filter and generally worse performance than that of the emulator originally used on the Wii, fans were not happy.</p>
	<p>The only true upshot of N64 emulation on the Wii U was the ability to play <i>Donkey Kong 64</i>, a game that has inexplicably not been made available for the Nintendo Switch Online service to date and was sadly last made available to dedicated Nintendo players some 15 years ago.</p>
	<p>Nintendo's NSO service has generally emulated N64 quite poorly, with notable lag and crap controller remapping, so perhaps the OG Switch hardware will see some of the upgraded action too. Hopefully with the launch of <i>Donkey Kong Bonanza</i> in July 2025, the OG 3D Donkey Kong experience might return to emulated availability in order to whet players appetites, getting them ready for DK's phenomenal-looking new outing.</p>
