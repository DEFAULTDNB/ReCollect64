	<h4>Freshly Brewed</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/n64brew.bsky.social">N64Brew recently shared news on Bluesky</a> that a talented individual on their Discord server has begun production on a sparky new homebrew game named <i>Pickle64</i>. The user in question is BoxingBruin, who shared a small cutscene engine system showcase teaser, as well as an indication of the direction of the game:</p>

They showcased their new cutscene system with this little video on the N64brew server:<br><br><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:kqxhqgxax64utjkh2qf42kmn/post/3lp6ci6blr227?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p>&mdash; N64brew (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:kqxhqgxax64utjkh2qf42kmn?ref_src=embed">@n64brew.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:kqxhqgxax64utjkh2qf42kmn/post/3lp6ci6blr227?ref_src=embed">May 15, 2025 at 1:55 AM</a></blockquote><script async src="https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

	<p><b>GENRE:</b></p>
	<p>RPG Platformer with boss fights akin to Dark Souls.</p>
	<p><b>ART STYLE:</b></p>
	<p>Very Atmospheric and will take inspiration from Majora's Mask in a lot of ways as well as other games that match it's energy.  It's my opinion that a vibe was lost with that game, and I haven't seen it return since.</p>
	<p><b>INFO:</b></p>
	<p>You will be playing the game as that polygonal cat creature you were transformed into. Though the cat is a meme the game will have a more serious tone.</p>
	<p>The world will be aiming for similar scale to OOT (as much as I can fit honestly).</p>
	<p>For music I'm using a SC-55 and SC-88 synth (these were used in development of OOT and other N64 titles so you should hear familiar sounds) + samples.</p>
	<p>It's using Libdragon + Tiny3D.</p>
	<p>Works on n64 hardware but first 10 seconds rests at 20-25 frames causing audio to desync but the rest is 25-40 (As long as my two point lights are disabled lol) and honestly looks even better with the smearing effect.  The scene still needs optimization.</p>
	<p><b>NEXT UP:</b></p>
	<p>Character controller and an environment level.</p>

	<h4>Majora's Moggy</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The game is set to have a cat protagonist and a Majora's Mask vibe, which are two things I can immediately get on board with. <i>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</i> was a somewhat marmite game, but I personally fell in love with the dark-side style in the promotional artwork, the storyline, characters and the overarching time-crunch.</p>
	<p>I have also always been a cat person, for those wondering!</p>

	<p>From the short but impressive video we have been presented, it looks like the main hero is an armour-clad knight who endeavours to rid the world of an as-yet-unnamed evil entity. The dark antagonist seems to have an all-seeing eye in the sky, akin to the moon in Majora's Mask, and dark magic capable of cursing people to be transformed into cats, at the very least.</p>
	<p>This in itself could lead to more puzzle/stealth-driven explorative platforming, as seen in titles like <i>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i> or <a href="https://annapurnainteractive.com/en/games/stray"><i>Stray</i></a>, for example. The additional premise of large-scale boss fights, similar to those seen in <i>Dark Souls</i>, is also more than exciting enough for me to be eagerly awaiting further footage, or perhaps even a test ROM to play!</p>
	<p>I will be checking out more homebrew from the N64Brew Discord in the near future, time permitting, but if you would like to join the server or keep up with BoxingBruin's developments, then please check out the links below.</p>
