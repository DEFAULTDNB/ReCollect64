	<h4>Silver Celebration</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Nicola Cusano is back with a massive overhaul for <i>International Superstar Soccer 2000</i>, giving it a 25th anniversay facelift, which includes a huge variety of updates from teams to names and player stats to unlocked features. This really is a joyous celebration of the now quarter-of-a-century-aged Nintendo 64 footy sim.</p>
	<p>Check out the full list of changes here:</p>

	<p><b>ISS 2000 — 25th Anniversary Edition ⚽🥅</b></p>
	<p><i>IMPORTANT:</i></p>
	<p>The goal was never to achieve absolute realism in player abilities.</p>
	<p>Instead, the focus has been on creating coherent and balanced attributes, so that the CPU can make logical substitutions and tactical decisions during matches.</p>
	<p>I feel the result is solid—but only you will be able to confirm that through gameplay.</p>
	<p>Error reports are welcome, especially regarding:</p>
	<p>Incorrect roles</p>
	<p>Wrong preferred foot</p>
	<p>vWrong formation assignment</p>
	<p>Missing players</p>
	<p>Incorrect physical build</p>
	<p>Any clearly obvious mistake</p>
	<p>However, I will ignore reports about minor stat discrepancies.</p>
	<p>For example:</p>
	<p>“Player A has 94 speed but Player B has 93, so Player A should actually be 95…”</p>
	<p>These are not relevant for the purpose of this patch.</p>
	<p>Please report only clear and meaningful errors.</p>
	<p>Thanks!</p>
	<p><b>What's in the archive?</b></p>
	<p>The archive includes the ROM and a mempak that’s fully compatible, with all the Stars Teams already unlocked.</p>
	<p>For full compatibility, as always, I recommend using Rosalie’s Mupen GUI. I haven’t tested the patch with other emulators.</p>
	<p>In general, Rosalie’s Mupen GUI is the emulator I suggest: it’s very up to date, similar to Project64 but without the limitations introduced from version 3.0 onwards.</p>
	<p>It also supports widescreen (there are tutorials on YT that explain how to enable it).</p>
	<p><b>Teams Overview</b></p>
	<p>Europe features 51 national teams.</p>
	<p>All EURO 2000 participants come with accurate rosters and authentic formations.</p>
	<p>Non-qualified teams include 22-player squads based on real appearances during the qualifiers. Their formations are slightly more interpretative, as many teams changed systems multiple times between 1998 and 1999. Player stats reflect their 1998–1999 form rather than the year 2000.</p>
	<p>CONMEBOL includes all 10 national teams from the 1999 Copa América with complete, original rosters.</p>
	<p>CONCACAF features all participants from the 2000 Gold Cup. The USA and Mexico use their 1999 Confederations Cup lineups. Haiti moves to the OFC group, replacing Papua New Guinea. Guatemala replaces Cuba.</p>
	<p>CAF includes all 16 teams from the 2000 African Cup of Nations. Senegal replaces Liberia, and Ivory Coast replaces Mali. Whenever possible, replacements were chosen based on similar kit colors. Other swaps: DR Congo replaces UAE, Zambia replaces Kazakhstan, Togo replaces Fiji, Gabon replaces Malaysia, Burkina Faso replaces India, Congo replaces Hong Kong.</p>
	<p>AFC includes 12 teams, all participants from the 2000 AFC Asian Cup. Indonesia and Lebanon replace North Korea and Nepal, again based on kit color similarity.</p>
	<p>Oceania includes Australia with their 2000 Oceania Cup squad and New Zealand with their 1999 Confederations Cup roster.</p>
	<p>Some national teams will have fewer than 22 players. For example, Gold Cup squads often listed only 18 players plus reserves, and reserve lists aren’t always available. Confederations Cup teams generally had 20. Missing players are replaced with “empty” placeholders that the CPU will not field.</p>
	<p><b>Special Teams</b></p>
	<p>World Stars feature a handpicked selection of legendary players without duplicating those already appearing in national teams. I might release additional versions of the All-Star teams later on.</p>
	<p>Euro Stars follow UEFA’s Team of the Tournament.</p>
	<p>All America Stars include missing standouts such as José Luis Chilavert, Paolo Montero, Fernando Redondo, Juan Sebastián Verón, Gabriel Batistuta, Óscar Córdoba, Álvaro Recoba, Hernán Crespo, and Giovane Élber.</p>
	<p>Africa Stars add Benni McCarthy.</p>
	<p>Asia Stars include Hidetoshi Nakata, Harry Kewell, and Mark Viduka.</p>
	<p><b>Missing Star Players</b></p>
	<p>What about important players who missed tournaments due to injuries or other reasons?</p>
	<p>Some appear in the All-Star teams (Vieri, Batistuta, Chilavert, Redondo, Montero, Verón, Nakata, Viduka, Kewell, Weah, and others).</p>
	<p>The remaining ones are placed in the 88 unused player slots. With the Editor — which will soon support proper height and weight editing and more — you’ll be able to assign them to any national team or club you prefer.</p>
	<p><b>Player Data Overhaul</b></p>
	<p>Every player has been fully reviewed:</p>
	<p>abilities, physical appearance and build, preferred foot, special skills, traits.</p>
	<p>Form and Morale have been rebalanced as well, which affects CPU substitutions, stamina recovery, and even the in-game “happy faces”.</p>
	<p>Each team has its Formation, Tactics, and Secondary Formation properly set.</p>
	<p>Some smaller national teams may feature generic roles or ratings due to limited data available from that era.</p>
	<p><b>Coming Soon</b></p>
	<p>New Scenario Matches, including all the finals from the era’s major tournaments such as the Confederations Cup and Gold Cup.</p>
	<p>Additional iconic matches from that period will also be included.</p>
	<p>With the upcoming Editor update, which will allow overwriting formations and more, I will create alternate roster versions from the era:</p>
	<p>• 1999 Confederations Cup (Germany, Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, Egypt, Brazil)</p>
	<p>• 1999 Copa América (Japan and Mexico)</p>
	<p>• 2000 Gold Cup (USA, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, South Korea)</p>
	<p><b>Possibly also:</b></p>
	<p>• 2000 Summer Olympics squads</p>
	<p>If enough reliable data surfaces:</p>
	<p>• 1999: UNCAF, Canada Cup, Pan American Games, FIFA World Youth Championship (U-20), and the FIFA U-17 World Championship.</p>
	<p><b>Why version 0.89?</b></p>
	<p>I removed 0.01 from the Scenarios because they’re still incomplete, and I noticed some issues with Home/Away kit handling and Formation/Tactics management.</p>
	<p>Another 0.10 was subtracted because of the graphics: aside from the corrected team names, almost everything else is still missing.</p>
	<p>For me, the final version will be reached once Flags/Logos, Kits and Scenario are fully finished.</p>
	<p><b>Special Thanks:</b></p>
	<p>Pedro Seidel – For his research on the ROM, his work on physical appearance, and for creating this fantastic community.</p>
	<p>Iván Herrera Herrera – For beta testing and for the brilliant insight on Form and Morale values.</p>
	<p>Andy Bowen – For beta testing and his passionate support.</p>
	<p>Tristiano Ronaldo (Mr. NBA) – For his help digging into the ROM; countless evenings studying the ISS64 ROM together, which helped me understand the other versions as well.</p>
	<p>A big thank you also to Anderson Maia, Renato Lordes, Rafael Oliveira Di Petta, and Luis Raul Angrisano, who have always taken part in the group discussions.</p>
	<p>And to the entire group — and anyone I may have forgotten.</p>
	<p>Finally, Ciro Chiumenti: thanks to our friendship and his Nintendo 64, we discovered this game and shared it together — a game that, in its own small way, marked our lives and gave us countless carefree hours.</p>

	<h4>Keepy-Ups</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As you can tell from the above text, a lot of effort has gone into fully customising the game, but much still remains for future versions. Once the kits, logos, and scenarios are completed, then this hack will be considered finished, but until then, Nicola and the team will continue to dig into the ROM data so that they can alter anything and everything that they can to produce the best ROM hacks going forward.</p>
	<p>Last but not least, if the data can be properly sourced, then the full 2000 Summer Olympic squad data as well as the 1999 UNCAF, Canada Cup, Pan American Games, FIFA World Youth Championship (U-20), and FIFA U-17 World Championship teams could make an appearance too. This is certainly something that the ISS community would like to see come to fruition, as the majority of these leagues have never made it into any ISS game to date.</p>
	<p>If you would like to give this game a whirl, then it is recommended that you use real hardware or an emulator, such as Rosalie's Mupen GUI (so you can import the MPK data easily). You can find the <i>Real International Superstar Soccer 2000 (Europe) (En,De) - v.0.89</i> .Z64 ROM (MD5: F128A2407CEB6B3D026F4D5720DE6B3F) over on the ISS2000 Fans Facebook pages today.</p>
	<p>Enjoy!</p>
