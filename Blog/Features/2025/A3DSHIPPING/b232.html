	<p>The long-awaited Analogue 3D console has begun shipping for preorder customers, and to begin the wave of excitement, the embargo for those lucky people who got to review the units early has also been lifted as of the 18th of November, 2025. Shipping of initial preorders is set to be completed by December the 1st, 2025.</p>
	<p>Sadly, ReCollect64 was not among the lucky review outlets that got theirs a couple of weeks ago, so I will be anxiously waiting for mine to be delivered in the coming weeks, where I will absorb everything I can first-hand and provide my own unbiased review of my first piece of 4K FPGA hardware.</p>
	<p>Without looking too deeply into the console review just yet, I have noted some interesting observations already, most notably the day-one incompatibility with <a href="https://krikzz.com/">Krikzz Everdrive 64</a>, which appears to be intentional given the reported compatibility with Mateusz Faderewski's open-source <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r2">SummerCart64</a> and that Marshall, creator of the UltraHDMI and 64Drive, is onboard with the design process.</p>
	<p>A post from friend of the site <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#c28">Gamrjerome</a> caught my eye too, noting that the total cost of just the pictured cartridges shown in the visual marketing comes to a staggering $852 (£650), so hopefully users of flashcarts will get some clarity on utilising their ED64s sooner rather than later.</p>

	<h4>FPGA Fanatics</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>One other point I noticed in early impressions (again, I'm attempting to avoid "spoilers" and watching full reviews to save my sanity and opinions on the hardware until I can focus on it in person) was that the console does not support OpenFPGA or save states. While this is not a deal-breaker, and was mentioned early on in the Analogue 3D's promotion, users seem to be annoyed that they cannot load any core they wish or save and load a state immediately once they've booted up their consoles.</p>
	<p>It stands to reason that Analogue, a company of few words, will probably add some of these features and fix compatibility with flashcarts over time, but it does seem strange that standard features of other Analogue products don't appear to have translated directly to the 64-bit console yet.</p> 
	<p>Did you preorder the Analogue 3D? Are you avidly watching the pre-release unfold? Stay tuned for updates and my impressions as and when they appear!</p>
