	<h4>Worth the Weight</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Nicola Cusano recently shared their latest tool in the series of modifications for the retro footy title. This version was initially built into the existing tools but has since become a standalone editor and focuses solely on rebalancing ISS 2000.</p>
	<p>If you're curious about the specific functions of these tools in relation to <i>International Superstar Soccer 2000</i>, Nicola recently provided a comprehensive explanation. Essentially, each player's skill has a different "weight" assigned to them depending on their position. With this editor, you can modify the weight of each skill and adjust how the overall rating is calculated for each role.</p>
	<p>It is also well known that goalkeepers have a 5–6 point bonus automatically applied to their ratings, and that this can also be removed with these tools. Additionally, Nicola has also added a fix for a bug in role calculation where the game calculates the Striker rating even when the role isn’t selected, and has added unlocking of the All-Stars teams automatically!</p>

	<p>Here it is — the long-awaited editor for overall weights by position!</p>
	<p>Most likely, your antivirus software will flag it as malicious. It’s not — the CRC calculation inside the editor triggers a serious warning in Windows! But it’s not a virus!</p>
	<p>The program is fairly simple:</p>
	<p>+ Numerical editing of the weights used in the overall calculation.</p>
	<p>+ Option to remove the ~5/6 point bonus given to goalkeepers.</p>
	<p>+ Option to fix the Striker overall calculation: by default, the game calculates the rating for MF-FW or FW even if Striker isn’t one of their roles.</p>
	<p>By disabling this, the rating will only be calculated if the player actually has the Striker role.</p>
	<p><b>It’s a beta, so make backups before editing.</b></p>
	<p>Due to the CRC recalculation, it's possible that the mempak associated with that ROM might no longer work — this depends on the emulator.</p>
	<p><b>**UPDATE 18/05/2025**</b></p>
	<p>Starting from v0.34, this tool only supports patching the PAL version of ISS2000 (International Superstar Soccer 2000 (Europe) (En,De).z64).</p>
	<p>Once the ROM is loaded, you’ll have 3 patch options:</p>
	<p>+ Wrong Striker Overall</p>
	<p>+ Set Overall to MAX value</p>
	<p>+ *New* Real weighted average formula</p>
	<p>+ *New* All Stars Patch</p>
	<p>A working method has finally been found to unlock the All Stars Teams without having to win the World Cup every time.</p>
	<p>How to use are inside the README.txt</p>

	<p>The abilty to rebalance Konami's soccer sim is a fantastic way to keep the game alive some 25+ years after it released. The <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b76">original tools, created by Nicola Cusano and Tristiano Ronaldo</a>, have already been used to great effect, modifying existing ROMs and ROM hacks, including translation and conversion into an updated version of the well known bootleg <i>Mundial Ronaldinho Soccer 64</i>. The latest version "Copa 2006" by Chris Jarocki, reflects the players names, stats and shirt numbers from the 2006 world cup.</p>
	<p>As always, please remember to create a back up of your vanilla <i>International Superstar Soccer 2000 (Europe) (En,De)</i> *.Z64 ROM (MD5: 9F101B6F6BEF4F267DEB5C6C37A24B97) as these tool will edit the file adhoc, and do not automatically create a backup of your original ROM.</p>
