	<p>Today SpK dropped a release trailer for their latest <i>Super Mario 64</i> ROM hack entitled "BAZR". The modification gives SM64 a new lease of life by incorporating deck-building, roguelike features, and a vast selection of moves to Mario's, or Luigi's repertoire.</p>
	<p>The game started life as a ROM hack over on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/simpleflips">SimpleFlips Twitch channel</a>, through a creative competition. 18 hacks were "commissioned", and SpK, anonymousmoose309, and furyiousfight3252 have excelled by converting the humble platformer into something much greater and with far more replayability!</p>
	<p>Now updated to version 1.0.2, <i>BAZR</i> pits you against the clock to collect stars, find cards and buy additional cards with your coins. Your moveset is replaced with a deck of cards, and it's up to you to shape exactly how you will traverse the Mushroom Kingdom using the titular B, A, Z and R buttons! You can check out the trailer here:</p>

	<p>Come on down to Luigi's Casino to try the brand new card game, BAZR!</p>
	<p>BAZR turns Super Mario 64 into a roguelike deck-builder with multiple unlockable decks and 100+ cards to find! Find coins in the level to buy new cards, collect stars under par time to get big bonuses, or find card pickups scattered throughout the stages to build your deck to take on Bowser's Gauntlet! </p>
	<p>Test your luck, skill, and SM64 knowledge!</p>
	<p>Hack by @anonymousmoose309, @furyiousfight3252, and SpK.</p>

	<p>The ROM hack is available through Romhacking.com as a BPS, which should be applied to the original 8.00 MB <i>Super Mario 64</i> U *.Z64 ROM with an MD5 of 20B854B239203BAF6C961B850A4A51A2. The resulting patched 1.0.2 ROM should have an MD5 of AC475593C99BAE389D57A5C2CD26FA91 and a size of 10.5 MB.</p>
	<p>Pleasingly, the patched ROM works flawlessly with <a href="https://github.com/Rosalie241/RMG">Rosalie's Mupen GUI (latest)</a>. using the default configuration, so no messing around is needed!</p>
