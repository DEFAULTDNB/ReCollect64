	<h4>Golden Opportunity</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With an added emphasis on stealth and detection, this ROM hack could be something very special indeed. Bringing 20 taxing covert missons to players who are up for the ultimate challenge of avoiding and destroying all of the cunningly placed and well-hidden/disguised monitoring systems around the stages, it sounds unambiguously fun!</p>
	<p>The addition of extra objectives will also bring another layer of freshness to the 28-year-old title. Judging by the screenshots of the levels, they look to be remixes of existing ones, offering fresh difficulties to overcome for the ultimate spy espionage action.</p>
