	<h4>Expansions Packed</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>This month, Retro Randy Price is back with an open beta for his action-packed WWF No Mercy</i> mod: <i>WWF No Mercy Plus V3</i>.</p>
	<p>This is one of the biggest and most expansive AKI wrestling mods, which crams in loads of larger-than-life characters such as The Big Show, Rovan, Pete Gas, Lilian Garcia and Coachman, to name but a handful!</p>
	<p>Patch V3 notably works on all flashcarts (with an expansion pak installed) as well as most emulators, and it disables anti-aliasing to improve the framerates of four-player matches. Check it out below:</p>

	<h4>Incre-mental Changes</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>V3 brings the patch to a point where it is open for the public to check out and leave feedback over on Retro Randy's Patreon.</p>
	<p>To play the game, you will need to patch the original <i>WWF No Mercy (U) [!] Z64</i> ROM with an MD5 of 04C492BE7F89FC6F425238BD67629544 using an <a href="https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/">online ROM patching site</a> or the included DeltaPatcher executable. The download includes the .FLA save file required for each to unlock the full roster, plus a readme to ensure you have the correct save type configured on your flashcarts.</p>
	<p>The use of a save game also, brilliantly, prevents unauthorised cartridge production sales. The .FLA validates the game and stops scumbag cloners from making money off these projects, of which none filters back to the original creators!</p>
	<p>Your patched ROM should have an MD5 of 37F84949154BBCE3488F4CE7CDE794E6 for the regular patch and an MD5 of B07C8529A49E047DFDEEC9BE5473651E if you choose to patch it for SummerCart64 without save validation. You can also use the latter on the included <i>mupen64plus_next_libretro_over64mb</i> core for RetroArch to achieve the best compatibility on a PC.</p>
	<p>Keep an eye out for my full official review of the wrestling ROM hack in the not too distant future.</p>
