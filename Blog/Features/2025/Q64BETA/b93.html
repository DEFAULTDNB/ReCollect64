	<h4>The Triality of Jack</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>You probably already knew that <i>Quest 64</i>, the first RPG for the N64, is also known as <i>Eltale Monsters</i> in Japan and <i>Holy Magic Century</i> in Europe, but did you know that the main protagonist has alternate names and there were meant to be more playable characters?</p>
	<p><i>Quest 64</i> began life as "Crystal Stories" in 1997 when Imagineer first began its development and starred a mage as a taller, more generic-looking knight who didn't yet have his trademark cape or chibi looks. The original idea was that the player could name their hero as they wished, questing around a gigantic map, meeting people, learning spells, and thwarting evil.</p>
	<p>By the time Space World 1997 rolled around, the game on display had been retitled as simply "Eltale" for Japanese players and "Holy Magic Century" for the rest of the world. The game would go through several significant changes that would end up with the overarching story blending elements of each stage in development. For example, the final game names the stolen tome as the Eltale's Book, the final boss would become Mammon, just four elements would make it to the final game, and only one playable character remained to play as.</p>

	<h4>Triple Threat</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>At the second stage of the game's development, <i>Crystal Stories</i> had changed it's name to <i>Holy Magic Century Eltale</i>. The game now featured a team of protagonists who were searching for three holy swords to save the world against Larva, an evil dark spirit handler. The three playable characters included Cozi, a 15-year-old pirate, Nina, a 13-year-old princess, and the 12-year-old unnamed male protagonist, who is very recognisable now as "Brian" in <i>Quest 64</i> (THQ, June 10th, 1998), "Jean-Jaques McCulloch" in <i>Eltale Monsters</i> (Imagineer, July 9th, 1999), or "Aryon" in <i>Holy Magic Century</i> (Konami, September 30th, 1998). Notably, none of the published releases allowed you to name your hero yourself.</p>
	<p>Interestingly, the main protagonist went through quite a few name changes even before having three names in three different regions. To begin with, the child-mage-hero remained completely unnamed, then was known as "Shanjaque", which was quickly shortened to "Jack", and ultimately changed again to Brian in the USA localisation of the game. Imagineer named the character "Jean-Jacque" in the Japanese version, which is believed to be an etymological remnant of the initial change from "Shanjaque" to "Jack".</p>
	<p>The change to "Aryon" from "Jean-Jacques" for the European is somewhat more puzzling, due to the already European-sounding name being altered yet again. The English language, European release, must have been put together hastily too, as the back of the NUS-NETP-EUR box still states that you "Control Brian", though the French and German releases correctly use the name "Aryon".</p>
	<p>Cozi, also known as "Kozi" during development in Japan, is suspected to have become "Kiliac Rabble" in the final game because the model used is strikingly similar. Kiliac is a ships captain who helps you journey towards Nepty, on the Isle of Skye, from whom you eventually obtain the water jewel.</p>

	</center>
	<p>Nina was also reused as Princess Flora of Dondoran, or "Flora Scottford", another bit part where the character in the final game didn't contribute much to the story in comparison to their original roles. While these characters played minor parts on the N64, the 2000 Game Boy Color demake, <i>Quest: Brian's Journey</i> <i>(Elemental Tale - Jack's Great Adventure: Satan's Counterattack</i> in Japan), these characters are of far greater importance to the game.</p>
	<p>The original trio of magical wizard (Jack), powerful pirate (Kozi), and healing princess (Nina), would have made for an interesting game where you would switch characters depending on the needs of the scenario at hand. Once the holy magic swords were discovered and their power combined, this would have proven to be a formidable force for good against the creeping evils of the game's antagonists.</p>

	</center>
	<p>The final stage of development turned the game on its head once more, removing two of the three playable characters, refining the combat and levelling system, and removing features such as the fifth element "Bubble". This spirit element would go on to become 98 collectible bubbles, hidden around the map, that serve to increase your other elements levels.</p>
	<p>Each character would become a supporting NPC instead of being entirely removed from the game, though their roles were severely cut down. Ultimately only magic was explored, through four elements, due to time constraints with Imagineer rushing to get the game out before any other RPG could hit the system.</p>
	<p>Two characters who didn't make the cut in the N64 edition but did have roles in the Game Boy Color demake were the travelling actor Dorey Lean and his companion Ham. These two were cut out of the final game, though their models and animations remain within the code. Modders <a href="https://x.com/MrTalida" target="_blank">MrTalida</a> and <a href="https://x.com/KessingerJustin" target="_blank">Justin K</a> discovered and restored them to a viewable state recently, getting them to work on a real cartridge using Gameshark codes. To do so, you need to be standing in the main entry hall of Limelin Castle, then set the 8 bytes starting at address 801A6E48 to 80211CF0 to load Dorey Lean, and 80213D24 to load Ham.</p>

	<h4>Storyline Switch-ups</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Originally the story played out that a priest named Larva, who was too powerful, became consumed with dark spirit handling. After being exiled from the holy land, he embarked on evolving his three evil spawns, feeding them the seven deadly sins of man and unleashing monsters on the land where a war ensued. The only way to end it was for three heroes to obtain holy swords and the Zeke crystal to banish the evil forces. In this version, Brian would have been a descendant hero, destined to fight Larva. Essentially, the hero of his time, if you will, which might sound familiar if you're a Zelda fan.</p>
	<p>The final game deviated from this format somewhat by stating that Lavaar, the champion of Celtland, opened the Eltale book, unleashing an evil entity known as Mammon. Mammon, jealous of the beauty within humanity, embarks on a campaign of darkness and war by spawning monsters and ravaging the land. During this time, Brian goes on a mission to locate his father, Lord Bartholomy (who in turn is searching for the stolen Eltale Book), and discovers that the elemental crystals have been pilfered by criminals. After battling Solvaring (Earth orb), Zelse (Wind jade), Nepty (water jewel), and Fargo (Fire ruby), Brian embeds them into his staff and confronts Mammon with the skills and abilities he has learnt along the way.</p>
	<p>The game also deals with some interesting subject matter, mainly by way of Shannon being an artificial human who was crafted by Mammon to prevent Lord Bartholomy (and Brian) from re-sealing the tome. Brian, finding the good in her, grants her life after the demise of Mammon, demonstrating the incredible power and compassion Brian has developed on his titular quest.</p>
	<p><i>Quest 64 / Eltale Monsters / Holy Magic Century</i> bears some eerie similarities to <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i>, with "Shannon" having a resemblance and role similar to that of "Impa", "Mammon", the evil beast's name, sounding a lot like OOT's boss character "Ganon", and they even share a character named "Epona". The latter is a powerful sage as opposed to a trusty steed, though the use of that exact name could be considered a strange coincidence. Epona was a Celtic goddess of horses and protector of the land, so the use of the name does bear relevance in both games.</p>

	<h4>The Quest for Ratings</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Ultimately, the Japanese edition, <i>Eltale Monsters</i>, would end up being the definitive version of the game due to its alterations, which came from extended development time. Some examples of the changes are the fighting mechanics, additional events, new dialogue, extra music added to menus, and using a circle instead of the octagon when in battle to prevent glitches. The Japanese release had an extended ending that shows all the characters, post-battle, including Lord Bartholomy. The game was also polished up to be less repetitive and a little harder than its USA counterpart. Ironically, the Japanese company that developed the game (Imagineer) made Japanese players wait a full year until after the USA release before they could take on this RPG.</p>
	<p>The game releasing almost a year after <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> (January 1997) and slightly before <i>Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> (December 1998) put it in a tight spot for consumers to choose to buy. On one hand, it would be the first RPG on the system, but on the other, Zelda was just around the corner, and FFVII was already dominating the charts for PlayStation owners with its turn-based battles, huge cast of characters, and plentiful FMV movies to punctuate the 30-40 hours of action. Quest 64 was not as epic, not as large-scale and not as cinematic as its peers, so it was destined to struggle, especially when aiming for release within that time frame.</p>
	<p>Where Zelda opted for real-time action and fighting, Quest leaned into the RPG genre with its turn-based battles and ability levelling system. The release of Zelda in 1998 directly impacted most aspects of Quest 64 success, mainly because Imagineer rushed to have the first RPG on the 64-bit system. The net result was a game many describe as an overly simplistic and formulaic walking simulator, with just 15 hours worth of gameplay. Though reviewers at the time praised the fact that RPGs were technically possible on the extremely limited storage of the N64's cartridge format.</p>
	<p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> packed in 30-40 hours of gameplay and is still heralded as one of the best games ever made, selling over 7.6 million copies worldwide. It is also one of the only titles throughout history to achieve perfect 10/10 review scores across multiple sites. Comparatively, <i>Quest 64 / Eltale Monsters / Holy Magic Century</i> garnered average scores of 6-7/10 and only sold 0.47 million copies worldwide, though a cult following and appreciation for the game remain strong, even to this day.</p>
