	<h4>Refreshed Recompilation</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Almost one year after Mr Wiseguy's <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b3">initial announcement of N64 Recomp, and Zelda 64 Recompiled</a>, the latest version, 1.2, is now available. This update bring compatibility with Mac OS, texture packs, performance improvements and full modding support!</p>
	<div class="container">
	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>Wondering about your save data when upgrading? Don't worry! Your save data is stored separately to the game itself. You can overwrite your old version and your save data will still be there, completely intact, and will work on the new version.</p>
	<p>Modding support has been added. Mods can be installed by dragging them onto the game window or by using the "Install Mods" button in the mod menu before starting the game. You can find many mods on the Thunderstore page at https://thunderstore.io/c/zelda-64-recompiled/. More info can be found in the readme.</p>
	<p>Texture pack support has been added. Texture packs are managed with the same menu as mods and installed in the same way. Some texture packs can be found on the thunderstore page linked previously.</p>
	<p>MacOS is now supported via a Metal renderer. Thanks @dcvz and @tanmaysachan!</p>
	<p>Many graphical optimizations have been added to improve performance on lower end GPUs.</p>
	<p>Various UI tweaks and improvements.</p>
	<p>A flatpak has been added for the Linux version. Please note that the AppImage has been removed due to some file picker issues it had.</p>

	<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/NtSDwwZqJ5A">Nerrel recently</a>, the reason we haven't seen lots of static recompilation projects come to light, nor tools, since the initial announcement is due to the ongoing effort being put into refining the framework, behind the scenes, to enable parity across future recompilations and more refined feature-rich experiences going forward.</p>
	<p>The project has seen massive performance gains since conception, and now using just a GT 730 with 2 GB of VRAM, you can achieve fully retextured games that run at a stable 60 FPS!</p>
	<p>To date, we know that <i>Super Smash Bros., Kirby 64 and the Crystal Shards, Chameleon Twist, Quest 64</i> and </i>Dinosaur Planet</i> are currently in the works from various people, as well as the previously mentioned <i>Superman 64, Rocket Robot on Wheels, and Banjo-Kazooie</i> from Wiseguy himself. Interestingly, potentially any ROM hacks, for example <i><a href="https://github.com/krm01/oot-indigo-mod/releases">TLOZ: Indigo</a></i>, could also be recompiled into 4K, 240 FPS, ultra-widescreen, modern-controlled versions with texture enhancements, mods and more!</p>

	<h4>Mods and More</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The functionality added to this project is essentially a framework for all projects going forward. This means that any games that are given the recompilation treatment will have immediate access to mods, texture packs, cheats, and more.</p>
	<p><a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/zelda-64-recompiled/">Thunderstore.io</a> is the latest name in mods, and will deliver patches and features to all games going forward. It already has a variety of content available for the Zelda Recompiled project that you can utilise today. Featuring anything from replacement character models, camera tweaks, and controller overhauls, this store holds everything you could need to improve or customise your game as you wish.</p>
	<p>Dario Samo has also hinted that since this framework is now flourishing, RT will now be focused on again, bringing yet another layer of polish to these already impressive projects.</p>
	<p>Let's hope that it isn't another year before we can get our hands on the full toolchain to make our own recomps!</p>
