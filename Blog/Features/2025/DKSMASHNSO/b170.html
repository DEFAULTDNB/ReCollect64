	<h4>Chimpy Chatter</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Occasionally, you come across a rumour that appears to have substance. Rewatching the NSO Switch 2 features update video again, at around the 39-second mark, I can kind of agree with what <a href="https://x.com/AS_12239">AS_12239</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ImakuniVT">Risa | Kuni</a> have been coming up with since yesterday evening. See for yourself:</p>

	<p>Did you catch it? The Gaussian-blurred background images do bear an uncanny likeness to a selection of existing N64 games that are currently not available on the service. Along with <i>Super Smash Bros., Forsaken</i>, and <i>Glover, Donkey Kong 64</i> could be making its way to the NSO after all, according to the sleuths, and of course, if this is admissible as hard evidence of possible future releases.</p>
	<p>If Nintendo were to release DK64 on its emulation platform, would it coincide with the release of <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i>? I think not. It would draw too much attention from the new title, so perhaps they might release the N64 title several weeks after the NS2 exclusives July 17th release date to keep the monkey mayhem flowing.</p>
	<p>The biggest questions we now have are: are these just placeholder images used in the background to gaslight us, or is Nintendo actually planting some little Easter eggs for internet detectives to find? Has Nintendo done this before, and have we missed it? It's certainly a mystery!</p>
