	<p>As of yesterday, EverDrive owner Krikzz made the ED64 X series compatible with the newly released Analogue 3D FPGA console. Today there comes another update which optimises the timings of the memory so that you can run your flashcart with the A3D's "Unleashed" overclock features enabled.</p>
	<p>This update doesn't require a bootloader update, so as long as you used an OG N64 to flash your cartridge to support the A3D yesterday, you only need to overwrite the FW with 3.10 today.
	<p>Every day we get better and better news about the Analogue 3D, but be sure to stay tuned for my full, unbiased review of the console in the coming days!</p>
