	<p>In a follow-up to the previous article, you know, <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b110">the mad one where Graslu00 completed <i>GoldenEye 007</i> on N64 with a Guitar Hero controller</a>, it seems that he has done it again, only this time he utilised an <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r3">InterAct V3 steering wheel</a> and played it all on a freaky little 13" Lightning McQueen TV/video combi unit, on April fools day!</p>
	<p>In the space of just under four hours, he manages to decimate the Janus criminal syndicate and prevent them from using the titular satellite weapon. Not only this, but he also smashes the two bonus levels, unlocks all cheats and ends the stream with a preview of his next trick, completing the game with a <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r5">Performance UltraRacer 64</a>.</p>
	<p>Below is the entire stream for you to gawp at; the level of skill it takes to do this is insane!</p>

	<h4>A Piece of Brake</h4>

	<p>Using a wheel with pedals requires not only extraordinary skill but a high level of coordination too. Using the default control layout with look up/down set to upright and auto aim on, the pedals act as backwards/forwards movement, the wheel is used to turn Bond left and right, and only the L/R buttons have been mapped to become the shoot button (Z-Trigger) to prevent him having to reach to the centre of the wheel to fire any weapons. Imagine horn-honking enemies to death.</p>
	<p>The stream is quite fascinating, with the aesthetic of a crazed lorry driver attempting to cross a field of potholes due to the frantic nature of the game's millimeter-perfect controls being translated to the driving setup.</p>
	<p>Both controllers featured in the stream have been reviewed here on ReCollect64, with the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r3">InterAct V3</a> scoring a brilliant 8 out of 10 for its customisable setup and rock-solid performance, and the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r5">Performance UltraRacer 64</a> scored a decent 6 out of 10 due to its questionable analogue controls, so it will be very interesting to see Graslu00 complete the game with that one!</p>
	<p><a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b108">Graslu00 recently reigned victorious in the GoldenEye Netplay LTK Cup V</a> held by <a href="https://x.com/THOneTwoSix" target="_blank">TH126</a>, besting the other 21 opponents to take the top spot for the third year running.</p>
