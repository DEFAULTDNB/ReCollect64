	<h4>Retrospective Round-Up</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>June 2025 marks the one-year anniversary of ReCollect64 going live. When I initially began the project, I was experimenting with features and some test articles around the end of May, with a view to releasing the site in mid to late June. But I wanted to get it out to the public, so I released it early!</p>
	<p>This site is a space where I can release my retro energy, sharing Nintendo 64-related news and memories, as well as posting reviews and findings that relate to the ReCollect64 Collectors App. Contrary to belief, I do this alone and unpaid, so every app, opinion or thought here is entirely my own work, unless specified that I have worked together with other people.</p> 
	<p>Over the course of the year, I have experimented with different sections; some have worked, others have not, and thanks to user feedback, the site is constantly evolving to find its flow.</p>
	<p>Across the span of just 52 weeks, I have put up a total of <b>236</b> pieces, which breaks down to <b>146</b> news and factual articles (147 including this one), <b>58</b> game and accessory reviews and <b>32</b> Q&As. I think you'll agree, that's not too shabby for a spare-time hobby!</p>
	<p>As well as covering <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b53">prototypes</a>, <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b88">character model comparisons</a>, <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b78">beta information</a>, compiling a <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b7">repository for operations cards</a> and even sharing new findings such as the previously unlisted <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b21">Scandinavian variant of Rampage World Tour</a>, I have discovered that the N64 community is thriving, thirsty for fresh information and new ways to enjoy their favourite games.</p>

	<p>The Q&A features are insightfully light-hearted reads that give us a peek behind the curtain with prominent and interesting characters from the retro gaming scene. Crucially, we have discovered that <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#c4">Emu_Kidid</a> still retains the highest tally in terms of the number of consoles owned, with 68, and the overwhelming topping of choice on a pizza is sausage!</p>
	<h4>Prospective Plans</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The main plan for year two is to continue with the recently increased article and review output, introduce new sections (which will be announced soon) and hopefully rework the site to an even more refined experience. Pages such as the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/64JS.html">64JS ROM information tool</a> and my work-in-progress <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/PTJS.html">Pad Tester app</a> will no doubt also see improvements from time to time too.</p>
	<p>I have improved lots of areas of the site already, such as limiting posts on the front page to ten, restructuring the navigation bar to be futureproof, improving the share bar down below, adding a primitive <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#s1">store</a>, creating pages that round up monthly information, a cumulative <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#HallOfFame">review scores hall of fame</a>, and a brand new <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#hist">N64History</a> section that will expand over time with as much detail as humanly possible.</p>

	</center>
	<p>The <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/index.html">ReCollect64 Collectors App</a> will also undergo improvements across the board, especially for mobile users, as well as more variants, manuals and artwork added, new and improved lists, and even more information for each title. The ultimate goal is to provide the ultimate experience in N64 collection tracking.</p>
	<p>If there is anything you would like to see covered in the future, or if you have something to contribute to the site or would like me to review your N64-related homebrew or products, please feel free to message me at any time to get the ball rolling.</p>
	<p>If you would like to help out regardless, I would love for more people to share article links, tag friends, and start up discussions on my social media posts. My dream is for more people to have access to and awareness of ReCollect64's existence, so please spread the word!</p>
	<p>Finally, a huge thank you to each ReCollect64 follower, all the Q&A participants and the various developers for a fantastic first year, I couldn't have don it without your support! Here's to many more N64-packed years ahead!</p>
