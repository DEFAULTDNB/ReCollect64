	<h4>Retro Reimagining</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>In 1998, <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> emerged as a modest platformer that enhanced the features of <i>Super Mario 64</i>. With its success came the spin-offs and sequels, and in 2003 THQ and Rare jumped at the opportunity to get the game into the hands of portable players, and the Game Boy Advance game <i>Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge</i> was the result.</p>
	<p>The spin-off was originally planned for the Game Boy Color and tentatively named <i>Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Curse</i>, though it was scrapped and retooled for the GBA incarnation.</p>
	<p>Fast forward 22 years, and hobbyist game designer Oakieland, along with animator/character designer TanookiTheReal, are breathing three-dimensional life into the 2D adventure title by giving it a spin through the <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity 6</a> game engine. The results, as you can see below, are phenomenal, with 2D points of interest being transformed into 3D versions that retain the original charm, updated with some modern flair, and all bespokely crafted within <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/developers/rules">Microsoft's terms of service</a> for fan games.</p>

	<p>Having watched the project progress over the past few weeks and after messaging Oakieland directly, here are a couple of key points regarding the project:</p>
	<div class="container">
	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i>
	<p>+ I want to place emphasis that it's a reimagining and not a remake, since I'll be cherry-picking from the final release, the prototype and the <i>Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Curse</i> documents, as well as more <i>Banjo-Kazooie/Tooie</i> design sensibilities.</p>
	<p>+ The character designer and animator is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TanookiTheReal">TanookiTheReal</a>.</p>
	<p>+ The composer for the videos is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sullyboyextras">SullyBoyExtras</a>.</p>
	<p>+ It's made in Unity 6.</p>
	<p>+ I am following Microsoft's TOS when it comes to fan-made content, so the project is called <b><i>BKGR Reimagined</i></b>.</p>
	<p>+ Using creative liberty, there are new areas in production that link POIs together.</p>
	<p>+ There is no guarantee that it'll be finished, but production is going very well right now.</p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>

	<h4>Amazing Architecture</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>	
	<p>The sense of vastness and scale around the points of interest is exciting. Given that <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> and <i>Banjo-Tooie</i> released in 1998 and 2000, respectively, it's fascinating to see a fresh look at a classic platforming series.</p>
	<p>Oakieland's open-world environments could certainly open up avenues for more adventurous gameplay. With the game taking beats from the lesser-known GBA title as well as the unreleased GBC prototype, there is a lot of room for manoeuvre when it comes to tucking away secrets and presenting puzzles that fans of the core games will have never seen before.</p>

	<p>With the game progressing nicely, there is a definite Studio Ghibli/<i>TLOZ: Breath of the Wild</i> scale and lustre to the project, with expansive vistas, layers of grass, trees and vegetation, and a distinct colour palette as well as the vibrant mix of lighting and shading that has been used.</p>
	<p>Locations look lush and have an inviting explorative element to them while still capturing the rural scenic outdoors look and feel of the original titles.</p>
	<p>Here is the latest WIP video with a quick tour of Spiral Mountain, and as you can see, while it's early work, it definitely has a gorgeous, visually appealing, aesthetic to it:</p>

	<p>I'll definitely be monitoring this project as it progresses, and hopefully we might get a playable demo of this superb-looking collect-a-thon platformer in the future!</p>
