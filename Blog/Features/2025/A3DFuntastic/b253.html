	<h4>Timeless Translucents</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The Analogue 3D has been out for all of a fortnight, but today Analogue has dropped a rather awesome announcement that they are bringing out a range of eight additional coloured consoles based on the Nintendo 64 Funtastic series colours, ready to ship before Christmas! The colours echo the Y2K era pops of colour that are associated with the iconic translucent coloured devices of a bygone era.</p>
	<p>The announcement comes just weeks after <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b243">ModRetro's M64</a> was revealed to have around a dozen colours in the works, though those ones will be purchasable separately and will be less focussed on matching the classic funtastic swathe of colours.</p>

	<p>The $299.99 coloured consoles include Jungle, Ice, Fire, Watermelon, Grape, Clear, Smoke and even one to match the limited edition Toys R Us Gold variant N64. To my eyes, these look pretty much spot on in terms of matching the original coloured consoles and will look brilliant when paired with matching controllers. It is however, a little bit of a kick in the teeth for us early adopters though, as we are now required to purchase another entire new console to bathe in the glory of these gorgeous shells. Hopefully Analogue will see fit to release kits so that people who bagged the white or black consoles day one will have options to customise their console.</p>
	<p>As <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b233">predicted in my previous post</a>, 8BitDo are also bringing out controllers to match, with the first one being the coolest of them all, Smoke Grey. I look forward to seeing more matching colours coming through regularly, I don't think they will release those all at once, rather, I predict that 8BitDo will drip feed them to us across the next 12-18 months. We shall see!</p>
