	<p>On April 27th, <a href="https://romhacking.com/competitions/b60de634-9150-488d-b124-7f33a5190855">Rovertronic announced</a> a contest for creating <i>Super Mario 64</i> ROM hacks with one stipulation: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Woul6sKLiz8">the mod must contain multiple Marios</a>. Fast-forward to July 2nd, and the winners were announced, and the hacks are here to play!</p>
	<p>Rovert provided the codebase, with various predefined functions whereby the mechanics for things such as the double cherries power-up and programmable clone NPCs are easily laid out for modders to start off with. All the participants had to do was make something interesting and fun to play out of it.</p>

	<h4>Worthy Winners</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With the winners chosen, and with very good reason, the top three not only walked away with some fascinating creations under their belts, but they also claimed cash prizes of $100 for first place, $50 for second, and $25 for third, plus mega amounts of kudos from the RHDC scene.</p>	
	<p>Expect me to give each of these a full playthrough in the coming weeks, and I will be providing my thoughts on the hacks in the form of individual reviews very soon!</p>
	<p>The next competition results to be announced will be from the previously reported <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b154">Mario Builder V1.1 contest</a>, so look forward to those playable levels coming to light, and my thoughts on them, coming soon!</p>
