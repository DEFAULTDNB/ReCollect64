	<p>When games enter production, developers tend to use all the resources they can to envelop themselves in the subject matter. From sketches to comics and memorabilia to props, they often surround themselves with related accoutrements in order to deliver something special for the fans.</p>
	<p><i>Resident Evil 2</i> was a landmark game for Capcom, even more so when it was ported to the Nintendo 64. The PS1 dual CD release in 1998 had 1400 MB worth of space to play with, whereas the N64 version, released in 1999, was confined to a mere 64 MB cartridge. The team behind the port, Angel Studios, put in incredible amount of effort to ensure it didn't lose too much in translation, and it shows.</p>

	<p>The cover art for <i>Resident Evil 2</i> differed across all three regions. The JPN release used a render of Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield; the USA one features an image from the print advertisement of a zombie's eye, and the PAL release had the strangest image of all, a creepy zombie photograph.</p>
	<p>With echoes back to the almost haunted-looking <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b84">Kazooie advert puppet being miraculously found</a>, writer, director, and producer <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm12242171/">Brandon Salisbury</a> has recently acquired the original mask that was not only used in the Japanese TV advert but also used on the box art for the PAL release.</p>

	<p>I am super pleased to be able to share this.</p>
	<p>I have acquired some of the applications used in George A. Romero's RESIDENT EVIL 2 commercial, including one of the most iconic pieces, used for the cover of the Japanese and European versions.</p>
	<p>The rest will be divided up to various organizations that Iâ€™ll be discussing with in a week, so that they are preserved and made available for the public.</p>

	<h4>Horrific Heritage</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Pioneer of horror movies, George A. Romero, had planned to film an adaptation of the first survival horror game, but sadly it never came to fruition. Instead, the only work of Romero's relating to the IP to be released was a short TV commercial for the second game. Why it wasn't utilised for the JPN or USA box art remains a mystery.</p>
	<p>Brandon Salisbury's documentary, <i>George A. Romero's Resident Evil</i>, released on January 7th, 2025, exposed fresh details on the adaptation Romero had envisaged and includes fresh interviews with the people who originally surrounded the project. It is likely that while making this documentary, Brandon managed to get someone to share some exclusive props with him; thus, this otherwise lost piece of history would possibly never have seen the light of day again.</p>
	<p>Finally seeing the mask in such detail, you can appreciate just how unnerving it is and why it was used for European marketing. What makes this discovery all the more exciting is that these prosthetics could have also been planned for use in the movie, not just the commercial, as the timeline coincides with pre-production of Romero's draft screenplay, which was eventually rejected by Capcom in 1998.</p>
