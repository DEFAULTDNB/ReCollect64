	<h4>Fantastic Mr McCloud</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The Harbour Masters have once again privided by bringing a port of <i>Star Fox 64</i>'s Centauri Alpha to the Nintendo Switch. The PC port of the game was released in December 2024, so this has taken around five months for this version to become a reality.</p>
	<p>In a similar fashion to how the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b98"><i>Majora's Mask</i> Switch port</a> is achieved, this one requires you to generate an *.O2R file, along with the NRO Switch executable.</p>
	<p>Once generated, you should have a 13.8 MB file (MD5: 5148D042D0AFFB950A8E5C4431F9CF09) that you can copy to an SD card with the NRO from the Switch build. The tools used are Kenix3's Libultraship, a library that provides reimplementations of libultra functions (the N64 SDK) which run on modern hardware.</p>

	<h4>State of Play</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The current state of the build is a little early; it has missing textures in the Great Fox opening sequence, and the radio communication audio is crackly, which can be resolved by turning down the voice volume to 80% and the master volume to 90%.</p>
	<p>Should you suffer any framerate woes, you can always overclock your Switch to get a little more grunt from the portable hybrid machine. You can use <a href="https://github.com/retronx-team/sys-clk">SYS-CLK</a> to crank up the speed of your console; just be careful when doing so, as it will shorten the life of your battery and may cause harm if used improperly.</p>
	<p>You will need the USA V1.1 ROM (MD5:741A94EEE093C4C8684E66B89F8685E8) and a PC to obtain all the necessary files from the original decompilation project. Then you need to generate the "sf64.o2r" that is required to run the game on a homebrew-enabled Nintendo Switch.</p>
