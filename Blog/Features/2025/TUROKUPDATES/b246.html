	<h4>Thrill-filled Trilogy</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>It's certainly interesting to note that while the original games received no updates or DLC from 1997 through to 2000 and beyond, the remasters are constantly being nerfed and buffed to tweak issues or add in new features that the originals didn't hope to have. The most notable changes presented here today are the inclusion of fixes to a beta pathway that was added back in to level 5 of Turok's remaster and crossplay multiplayer being fully functional for Turok 2!</p>
	<p>Having recently finished reviewing the remastered trilogy, I found that these games are still incredibly playable and full of vibrance and nuance that only games built in the Nintendo 64 era could possibly contain. I have to admit that the modern controls and things like gyro aiming really do make the game more accessible to modern gamers with modern gaming traits and expectations, but they're merely shiny facades to some genuinely good core FPS gameplay built by Iguana and plublished by Acclaim throughout the late 90s.</p>
	<p>Of the three, my favourite is STILL <i><a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r75">Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</a></i>, which I scored a stellar 9/10, followed by <i><a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r60">Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</a></i> with 8/10, and last but not least <i><a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r88">Turok: Shadow of Oblivion</a></i> with a generous 7/10 score. I didn't really notice any of the issues addressed in today's patches, other than the enemies constantly respawning in each area. These QOL updates also demonstrate that Nightdive actively listens to fan critique, making the games all the more immersive and enjoyable in a variety of new ways.</p>
	<p>Which game was your favourite of the three? Have you replayed them recently? Let us know!</p>
