	<h4>Getting Physical</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>In a partial victory for physical media enthusiasts and Turok fans, myself included, Nightdive Studios has today announced that their remastered trilogy of prehistoric games is getting a hard copy release on October 31st, with preorders opening from today.</p>
	<p>That's right, <i>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</i> and <i>Turok 3: Shadows of Oblivion</i> are all being released on disc and cartridge for PS5 and Nintendo Switch, respectively.</p>
	<p>The best part of the news is that all games will be available on each format in full and without the need to download one or all of the games in the series. It's also not being handled by Limited Run Games, who have previously sold the three games individually in their titularly limited numbers.</p>

	<h4>Xbox, Excused</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>It's not all plain sailing though; Microsoft's Xbox has been notably left out from the lineup through no fault of Atari's. This adds further credence to the increasingly swirling rumours that Xbox is ditching physical media in order to focus on pushing a unified experience across other formats such as smart TVs and handhelds.</p>
	<p>With Xbox players only able to grab the games digitally, it means that if they ever get pulled from the store, they will no longer be available, which is not unheard of and definitely makes a case for having a hard copy available to purchase to keep forever.</p>
	<p>It's unlikely that a physical release will appear for Xbox Series X, which is a blow for fans of the series. The only way to obtain them on disc was to purchase the three games on <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/search?q=turok&filter.p.m.custom.video_game_platform=Xbox&filter.v.price.gte=&filter.v.price.lte="> Limited Run's site</a>, though they sold out a long time ago and traditionally never restock, hence the name, so now the second hand market will have the stranglehold on Xbox copies.</p>
