	<h4>An N64-Style Adventure</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Four days ago, InDenial Studios showed off their latest alpha footage (3.0.0-alpha.1) from their Metroid-inspired N64-styled project dubbed "Another Metroid 64", or AM64 for short.</p>
	<p>The project's inception can be cited to around five years ago, with a demo of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=300dvpVCjgA">"Super Metroid 64"</a>, which was essentially a 3D interpretation of the original side-scrolling SNES game, containing 3 levels, destructible objects, enemy hit points, animated movement and a basic HUD and textures borrowed from N64/SNES/NES and GBA games.</p>
	<p>The real build-up to something tangible began around ten months ago, with the InDenial founders, Natalie Oyague and Michael "Quirk" Dorsett, who personally attempt to inject some nostalgic retro-stylised gameplay into modern incarnations of recognisable game franchises, releasing a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiXWa3aNCGw">gameplay and mechanics trailer</a>, which demonstrated a refreshed N64-style HUD, targeting systems, an FPS arm-cannon view and, most importantly, the morph ball mode!</p> 
	<p>Their latest statment also demonstrates a bleeding-edge build of the game with a few interesting developments:</p>

	<p>Alright, it's time. If you know you know. AM64 / Metroid 64, V 3.0.0-Alpha1 technically. A taste of the next mission is around the corner. This ain't for the general public but you guys made us get this thing to where it is. Any my former higher Patreon tier members will be contacted as well. It's a janky alpha, but it feels so so Metroid. And it's hard. Really damn hard. Soon, a few more optimization tweaks here or there, but very soon.</p>

	<h4>Metroid Makeover</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Though the game clearly is not designed to run on the Nintendo 64 hardware, it is commendable that the duo has put so much time and effort into styling this game towards N64 sensitivities. The on-screen C-buttons, the polygonal aesthetics, the retro textures and foggy environments certainly do hark back to the system's greatest assets, its gorgeous 64-bit visual nuances.</p>
	<p>Looks-wise in the latest trailer, there has been a distinct upgrade to the engine used, which I assume is Unity, as the quality appears to be far greater and much smoother than that of the last gameplay and mechanics trailer, and notably there is less use of scan lines, no red energy bar present and an added timer! The Veilwood area, which features in both clips, has had a massive upgrade too, with more atmosphere in the lightened fog, and layers of leaves and vines littering the main trunks that obscure your path. The sound effects have been enhanced too, with notable Z-targeting lock-on sound effects from <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> creeping in at points, which I don't mind at all, but there are also more Metroid-esque sounds throughout that give it an authentic feel.</p>

	<p>The biggest thing I noticed, or rather, didn't notice, was the inclusion of Samus' first-person-view arm cannon. Has it been removed because it was too GameCube-looking rather than N64-themed? Regardless, the GameCube-inspired menus look fantastic. I have always admired the <i>Metroid Prime</i> look and feel when it came to the menus and select screens, so I can see why they have chosen that aesthetic.</p>
	<p>Another Metroid 64 seems far from complete, with no overarching story beats, and not too many puzzles or bosses revealed just yet. I wish the developers all the best with this one, because it looks very pormising. Hopefully it won't be another 10 years before we get to play the final product, and moreover, I hope it doesn't get cancelled or given up on like <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b123">other previously reported Metroid 64 fan projects</a>.</p>
	<p>Hopefully, when a playable version gets released, I can share my thoughts on it. Here's hoping for a public test build sooner rather than later.</p>
