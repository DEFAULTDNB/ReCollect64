	<h4>Superbly Bricked, Dude!</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Following my previous post about <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b31" target="_blank">Super Brick Dude's <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> LEGO Map of Hyrule</a>, this weekend Super Brick Dude completed and released the project on Rebrickable.</p>
	<p>This build is a behemoth of a piece, with over 2558 parts. Originally, Super Brick Dude had projected that it would weigh in around the 2000+ piece mark, depending on detailing in the mountain and valley regions of the map. The projected cost when it was just 30% complete was around the £150-£200 mark.</p>
	<p>With the project now out in the wild, Rebrickable mentions that there are 562 different pieces used in this MOC, with 2558 pieces in total. The total cost of these parts is £297 at the time of writing plus $19.99 for the PDF file instructions. While it adds up to slightly more than originally projected, you can see where the extra detail has gone into the build since I first spotted it in September. I'm sure we can all agree that it's utterly stunning and worth every penny if you're going to invest. Interestingly, it is still cheaper and more authentically detailed than any of the large official Nintendo LEGO sets on offer today.</p>

	<p>This is my Map of Hyrule, as seen in Ocarina of Time. This beautiful but simple Microscale model is built right onto a Light Bluish Gray 48 x 48 baseplate.  My design is based on the in-game Hyrule from Nintendo's 1998 "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time" on Nintendo 64.  This is my first design based on a Nintendo 64 game - or a 3D game in general.  Due to the large amount of clouds covering the map, I have added "lids" to the areas that open to reveal more detailed scenes from some noteworthy areas of the game.</p>
	<p>My PDF instructions feature an Ocarina of Time themed page layout- true to the game! The 2,558 pieces used to build this model are divided into 897 easy-to-follow steps- all painstakingly translated to PDF across 882 vibrant pages in total (including Cover Page & Bill of Materials.)  I have split this massive file into 4 PDFs for easier download and storage, all of them about 50MB (200MB total.)</p>
	<p>This is my largest map design with a lot of features and would be an amazing display piece for any Legend of Zelda or Nintendo 64 fan!  Thanks for looking, I hope you like it!</p>
	<p>** NOTE: The four 'Slope, Curved 4 x 2 x 2 Triple 6216' used for the handles on the lids in most of the renders look nice but are scarcely available in real life.  I mistakenly used some renders and made the instructions with them. I added a small set of instructions to the download list to brick build the clouds instead.  I have also updated the part list to reflect this change. **</p>

	<p>SuperBrickDude has no end to his talents, and what's next on the horizon could be another exciting N64 game-themed chapter. Maybe he will tackle the <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i>'s seasonal themed main map, with the giant stone-carved Wizpig face in the centre, or perhaps something realistic like the Chemical Weapons Facility from <i>GoldenEye 007</i>.</p>
	<p>Whatever he chooses to create, you know it's going to be amazingly accurate and incredibly detailed. Please give Super Brick Dude a follow on Facebook to keep up to date with all his latest creative developments.</p>
