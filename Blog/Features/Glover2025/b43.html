	<h4>Glovely Jubbly</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Glover was initially released for N64 in November of 1998! I remember playing it and being in awe of the animations and puzzle elements. Glover was also released for PC at the same time, and it eventually came to PlayStation a year later, in 1999.</p> 
	<p>More recently, the titular glove was given an outing on Evercade (April 2024), the portable, cartridge-based emulation machine by Blaze entertainment--yes the same Blaze of Ultra 64 SFX 64 adaptor and Xplorer 64 cheat device notoriety in 1997.</p>
	<p>Piko Interactive were responsible for the Evercade port and the 2022 Steam release, though on Steam it has so far recieved 194 "mixed" reviews (60% positive), with most people complaining that the game is riddled with bugs, slow down, and that it's essentially a lazy port with poor controls. The Evercade release fared a little better, probably because it was the first 64-bit game to arrive on the system as part of the Piko Interactive Collection 4 cartridge.</p>
	<p>This time around, QUByte Interactive and Bleem! have seen fit to bring the game to Xbox Series S/X, PlayStation 4 and 5, and the Nintendo Switch, so everyone will be able to enjoy the Glove/Ball double act in 2025.</p>

	<h4>Handy Dandy</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Featuring the full 30 levels across 6 biomes, Glover's latest release will also contain a gallery mode to display all the concept art associated with the title's development back in the day. The biggest question I have is, how will the game control? Will they do the right thing and offer both modern and OG control schemes to appeal to more demographics? We shall see.</p>
	<p>Otherwise, the port is shaping up beautifully and is set to feature massively enhanced resolutions and framerates compared to the N64 original. This iteration also brings aspect ratio options, filters (such as CRT style scan lines), and online high score leaderboards so you can flex on your friends!</p>
	<p>I will more than likely pick this up on PlayStation 5 or Nintendo Switch, so please keep your eyes peeled for a review of the revitalized 3D puzzle platformer on ReCollect64 in the future.</p>
	<p>You can watch the YouTube trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWWfYGcAbwg" target="_blank">HERE</a> and decide for yourself which format you're going to replay it on first!</p>
