	<h4>Tombstone Testing</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Nintendo 64 developer cartridges are famously elongated and massive, but why was that? The main reason for the gargantuan slab was that within the cartridge were bigger circuit boards housing rewritable chips and additional RAM, often crudely denoted on the front as Flash/RAM (128 MBit/256 k, for example).</p>
	<p>Almost every developer had access to these 4 Mbit to 512 Mbit capacity cartridges from Nintendo, along with various SDK hardware and accompanying hardware/software to upload the game to the cartridge ready to test. These carts were meant for internal testing and samples for journalists, for example, and were not meant for the average person to ever see.</p>
	<p>Some of these developer carts contain beta versions of games we recognise today, or even prototype games that never made it to retail. The latter will be the ones I'm going to focus on throughout this article.</p>
	<p>Numerous games were proposed for the N64, but only 388 titles made it to general sale (not including variants) within the console's limited lifespan.</p>
	<p>Below is a list of 26 games that had their prototype ROMs dumped and preserved from development hardware, though I will be zeroing in on 21 of them. Feel free to click on one to jump directly to it within the article!</p>

	<h4>Regional Prototypes</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>To keep things simple and to focus on the more interesting prototypes, I will quickly bundle California Speed, Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, Spacestation Silicon Valley, StarCraft 64, and Taz Express together as games that got a release in one way or another but had regional versions cut at the last minute. Beyond there being no major differences in the ROMs other than the region header, and in some cases languages and bug fixes, the games were effectively exactly the same.</p>
	<p><i>Space Station Silicon Valley</i> is a particularly peculiar example in this bunch because they went to all the trouble of localising it into Japanese, and yet they still never released it in the NTSC-J region. Very little has changed within the data, compared to the USA/EUR ROMs, other than the NSV<b>J</b> NUS ID, cutscene timings, and the language itself. The reason for this: the ROM was built to be identical across regions (apart from headers and ID's), and through the use of GameShark codes, it is even possible to unlock the Japanese language option in any EUR or USA ROM!</p>
	<p>The German version of <i>StarCraft 64</i> has the ID NUS-NSQ<b>D</b>-NOE (D for Deutsch/German) and has the language specifically translated for that country. The Australian PAL version of the game has the ID NUS-NSQ<b>P</b>-AUS, and the ROM data is virtually identical between the two of them; why this version didn't see a release is bewildering.</p>
	<p>The truth is that the majority of these games didn't release simply down to deadlines, profit/loss ratios within the target region, manufacturing costs, or ultimately poor sales dampening the idea of releasing the same game again but in other regions.</p>

	<h4>40 Winks</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>40 Winks was devised around 1998 and was created by Eurocom in 1999, but it eventually came out on N64 in 2019 through Piko Interactive. It was released as a grey cartridge regular edition and as a special edition black cartridge through a successful kickstarter campaign.</p>
	<p>The game's development was relatively straightforward, with it being designed with small children in mind and graphical effects on par with <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> and <i>Super Mario 64</i>. The N64 version has a two-player cooperative mode (playing as both children; Rough and Tumble) and expansion pak support, but the game was never officially released due to the PlayStation version's lacklustre reviews and generally poor sales.</p>
	<p>Piko Interactive began a kickstarter in 2018 and stated that the N64 version would be the first commercial game released for the system since it was discontinued by Nintendo and that it would be completely playable as it was intended to be back in 1999. They largely lived up to these promises, but beyond that, things turned strange.</p>

	</center>
	<p>The N64-related stretch goals were interesting, but ultimately disappointing products came instead of what was promised. Look at the state of the N64 controller they advertised versus what they put out. The final product was a third-party controller of questionable quality.</p>
	<p>Considering the company made $131,252 in pledges against a $20k target and garnered 1709 backers, I would have thought they could do better than that. It's not the official offering we had hoped for; instead, it was a Tomee controller with slow and turbo functions, and these controllers were notorious for not working for long.</p>
	<p>Don't even get me started on the state of the Wakey Wakey plushie toy...</p>

	<h4>Carnivalé: Cenzo's Adventure</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Carnivalé: Cenzo's Adventure was a twisted-toony puzzle-adventure game by Terraglyph Interactive that was cancelled in 2001. The ROM was dumped in 2022 from a 128M developer cartridge that contained a beta that was roughly 60% complete. The game actually can be completed, but huge portions of it use placeholder assets or are far from finished.</p>
	<p>In the game, you have to explore around a Tim Burton-style circus, solving mazes, collecting silver, and playing fairground-style mini games. The biggest problem with this prototype is that the game offers you very little sense of direction and tends to crash frequently.</p>
	<p>The game actually looks fantastic and uses parallaxed backgrounds and bright, vibrant colours to achieve a very stylish, twisted look throughout.</p>
	<p>Carnivalé had a well-designed cartoony aesthetic because it was based on a French-Irish animated film from 1999 called, you guessed it, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivale_(film)" target="_blank">Carnivalé</a>, starring Huge Laurie as the voice of Cenzo. Unfortunately, the film didn't do too well, and with N64 sales declining in 2001, it was ultimately canned.</p>
	<p>Oddly, the game features not only a single-player mode but also a two-player <i>Mario Kart</i>-style racing mode with 10 playable characters (five to unlock) and five tracks (four to unlock) to choose from. This mode also has collectable power-ups to use against each other, but the fun is very short-livedand feels tacked on.</p>

	<h4>Die Hard 64</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Believe it or not, John McCleans Christmas film--yes it's a Christmas movie--Die Hard was due to come to N64 in game form at some point in the year 2000. Sadly, the game never got completed, but a ROM dump (actually 3 dumps) that was found on August 30th, 2017 by an ex-employee of Bits Studios named 10ahu lets you play almost an entire game!</p>
	<p>Bits Studios also made <i>RiQa</i>, a third-person action game that you will see more of below, and <i>Thieves World</i> (working title), a game about stealth action bank heists, that eventually evolved into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_Ops" target="_blank">2003's <i>Rogue Ops</i></a> on Xbox, GC and PS2.</p>
	<p>Die Hard 64 was originally going to be a FPS SWAT game called <i>Muzzle Velocity</i>, but when Bits Studio got a publishing deal with Fox Interactive, this changed to Die Hard (after briefly being penned as a game to be based on <i>Speed 2</i>, which interestingly enough was actually the original script and premise for <i>Die Hard 3</i>!).</p>
	<p>When I found out about this prototype being dumped in three parts, I immediately assumed it would be like the Die Hard Trilogy game on the PSX, featuring individual levels and playstyles per movie, but instead the prototype is purely first-person shooter in the same vein as <i>GoldenEye 007</i>. Each dump contains four levels, split into portions, and also has built in cheatmodes, debugging toggles, and AI tests.</p>
	<p>This game ultimately went on to become Die Hard Vendetta on the GameCube!</p>

	<h4>Dinosaur Planet</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>This was a huge one for me because the game not only came directly from Rare's camp, but it contained dinosaurs, exploration, and a lengthy story mode akin to <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i>. First shown at E3 2000, <i>Dinosaur Planet</i>, as it was then known, featured Sabre and Krystal as swappable heroes throughout the prehistoric adventure.</p>
	<p>The ROM was found in 2021 after the purchase of a CD-ROM in a Swedish auction, and the build date of the dump, December 2000, suggests that the game was one of the last versions produced before the game was completely reworked to become <i>Star Fox Adventures</i>, with the help of Shigeru Miyamoto rewriting the narrative to fit Fox McCloud and the gang instead of the original cast. Interestingly, Sabre was not always the main protagonist; it was in fact meant to be Timber the Tiger of <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i> fame. This is possibly due to the game entering production around 1997, hot on the heels of DKR's release.</p>
	<p>NUS-NDPE-USA V1.0 was freed from Rare's copy protection by <a href="https://x.com/luigiblood" target="_blank">LuigiBlood</a> and released for us to experience in February of 2021. The game was in a pretty poor state in terms of being able to play it, and as such, the community has picked it and run with it, providing bug and crash fixes, reworking the levels to flow together, and fixing missing textures and objects that were needed to make the game playable.</p>
	<p>While the game remains unfinished and incompletable, the Dinosaur Planet FindersClub is still in the process of providing fixes and patches for the ROM, with the last available patch coming in August of 2024 on their <a href="https://discord.com/invite/dinosaur-planet-tm-findersclub-813128067185770526" target="_blank">official Discord channel</a>.</p>

	<h4>Doubutsu Banchou</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>Animal Leader</i> aka, Doubutsu Banchou, started life as a 64DD title and was eventually downgraded to an N64 cartridge after lacklustre sales of the system-addon. The game was intended to be released in 2001 after being shown at Space World 2000, but eventually found a home on the GameCube in 2002 under the name <i>Cubivore: Survival of the Fittest</i>!</p>
	<p>What is interesting about this 256Mbit prototype that was dumped in 2021 (by Team Carrot), is that the intro was retooled from having an N64 logo creature to a GameCube logo creature, and the controls and menu systems were all reworked for Nintendo's successor to the Nintendo 64. The game is around 99% complete, but the ROM size suggests it was in need of heavy optimisation before it could have been released, preferably on a smaller 128Mbit cartridge to lower production unit costs.</p>
	<p>Gameplay-wise, the game's strategy elements remain intact, though it was said that it's evolution system's complexities would only be fully realised on the GameCube due to the increased storage size of the 1.46GB mini-DVD discs, and the enhanced processing power of the new Gecko/Flipper CPU/GPU hardware.</p>
	<p>Doubutsu Banchou could probably have made it to retail on the N64 if it weren't for the console coming to the end of its life so suddenly. Thankfully, we can play this ROM on any emulator or flash cart and enjoy it as it was intended!</p>

	<h4>Dragon Sword</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Dragon Sword is another title that Piko Interactive wants to bring back to the mainstream on a physical cartridge. Originally developed by Interactive Studios in 1997 and set to be published by MGM Interactive by 1999/2000, this action RPG began life as a <i>Ocarina of Time</i>-like adventure game before being reimagined as a beat 'em up game akin to a 3D version of <i>Golden Axe</i>. The game was delayed from 1999 to 2000 in order to make it a 4-player game instead of the intended 2-player cooperative release.</p>
	<p>There are two prototypes dumped, one from Europe with a 3D spinning N64 logo and MGM branding, whereas the USA dump has a flat N64 logo image and no branding, with a creation date of August 1999. The European version feels more complete and polished than the USA one, which means it must be a newer buld, because the European one has the four correct characters, greyed-out modes if additional pads aren't connected, and proper loading screens that give details about objectives. Graphically, the EUR ROM has a credit system, combo counter, and refined graphics. The USA ROM tends to crash more, and the graphics are visually a step backwards from the other dump, even though there are improved animations, more varied enemies, and more weapons to pick up.</p>
	<p>The prototype ROMs contain an almost complete and very playable game under the internal name "DragonStorm" and have a single player and cooperative adventure mode as well as VS multiplayer options for deathmatch, team battle, chykyn chase, and slayfest. Interestingly only adventure mode boots, but of the 4 available players (Kailan, Cutter, Aisha, and Chykyn), selecting Chykyn, who resembles a chicken-type bird, actually lets you play as a green enemy grunt rather than the green brute character Gouranga, who makes up the fourth character instead of Chykyn in the European version's character select.</p>
	<p>Dragon Sword has seven playable levels, three lost levels, and even a developer mode hidden within the "Load Data" option. This unlocks a variety of options, such as a level select and god mode! Interestingly, when attacking some enemies, there is a placeholder portrait of Darth Maul next to the NPC's energy bar.</p>
	<p>If Piko Interactive does intend to release the game in 2024, they're running out of time. They picked up the rights back in March of 2020 and stated that they would be giving it a physical release this year, but with just one month of the year left and no word on a release date, it looks unlikely for the time being.</p>

	<h4>Freak Boy</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Devised by Zono in 1996, <i>Freak Boy</i> is a puzzle-platformer that was intended for release in early 1997. Originally developed under the name "Stacker", the game went through several iterations before being put on indefinite hold in 1998 by publisher Virgin Interactive.</p>
	<p>The ROM was dumped on June 28th, 2020 after a successful GoFundMe campaign held by Olivieryuyu (Team Carrot). The prototype ROM feels very early on, yet there are 25 levels, and the playable character, the titular Freak Boy, is composed of three body parts that have to be augmented or super-morphed by collecting coloured crystal/rock-like pieces	in order to solve puzzles or defeat enemies. The game was set to feature mechanics like shooting, drilling, and warping around with your newly upgraded form. Combinations of traits could be used to further add variety to the gameplay.</p>
	<p>There is no HUD, cutscenes, story outline, or musical score to accompany this early alpha build, just a sparse atmospheric track throughout, and the odd sound effect here and there, so playing it is very bleak, foggy, and with very little direction given. The story, according to the developers, was that this takes place on Earth, where aliens, known as ZoS, have invaded the solar system with the intent to extinguish the sun and capture all humans.</p>
	<p>The games turbulent timeline of being restarted, overhauled, and scrapped meant that countless delays pushed the game back until it was no longer viable to release. It was also deemed not vibrant or happy enough for Nintendo to give the seal of quality to. You can actually feel that by playing the prototype, the game is packed full of potential but comes off feeling very underwhelming.</p>

	<h4>Frogger 2 Swampy's Revenge</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Frogger 1 never appeared on the N64, but two, yes two, prototypes exist for <i>Frogger</i>'s sequel, <i>Frogger 2 Swampy's Revenge</i> which, was developed by Interactive Studios around 1998. Who is Swampy, I hear you ask? He's a Crocodile that Frogger used to jump across a river in a previous game, and he wants payback by kidnapping Frogger's girlfriend Lillie's multitude of baby frogs. The 90's were wild times.</p>
	<p>Released by Team Carrot in October of 2005, Frogger 2 features all the manic action of a typical Frogger game, with the added gameplay mechanic of collecting baby frogs and the extra pizzaz of the N64's cartoony graphics. The game was set to be a sequel to the 1997 Frogger reboot, which did release on PS, GBC, Windows, and DC, though the N64 version's development was cancelled early on, after just two levels were ported to the system.</p>
	<p>Within the prototypes there is a model viewer, world selection (that crashes), Andy's playpen (does nothing but is named after Andy Eder), and a record keyring mode where you would record high scroes. They both contain just two levels named "Flat Level" and "Docks Level", so there is not much to do other than die repeatedly, though you do have 99 lives by default. Neither ROM contains any sound at all.</p>
	<p>The most interesting addition to the ROMs is that they contain "Retro" Frogger, which is a faithful port of the original arcade game.</p>

	<h4>Glover 2</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Though this game doesn't even have a titlescreen, <i>Glover 2</i> was shaping up to be a damn fine game from Interactive Studios. As a sequel to 1998's <i>Glover</i>, it was set to feature more levels, more puzzles, and even more whacky moves and abilities than the original game, though the prototypes that have been found amount to only roughly 60% complete since it's inception in 1999.</p>
	<p>Two ROMs exist for this game, both from January 1999. They were dumped and distributed on the 22nd of November 2019 by Team Carrot, though prototype 2, which was released in February 2021, is actually a redump of prototype 1, because of corrupted data in the initial ROM that was dumped in 2019.</p>
	<p>Fourty areas have been found in the dump, and more are hidden away, as well as the entire soundtrack from the first <i>Glover</i> game. Pressing "L" on the "Save Game Select" menu option opens a level select, and pressing "L" in the pause menu brings up debug options and editors.</p>
	<p>On April 18th, 2024, QUByte Interactive posted on Twitter/X that they will be <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b43" target="_blank">bringing Glover back to consoles in 2025</a>, but at the same time they mentioned the <i>Glover 2</i> beta, saying that the game was never played before. Will they be the ones to complete the work of the developers 25 years ago? I certainly hope so!</p>

	<h4>Mini Racers</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Developed by Looking Glass Studios from 1998 to 2000, <i>Mini Racers</i>, or <i>Surikka Rajikka</i>, was a racing title that put you in control of R/C cars racing short-lap courses in a similar style to an amalgamation of <i>Micro Machines 64 Turbo</i> and <i>Re-Volt</i>.</p>
	<p>Once the game was announced in 1999 at E3, it was due to release by October the following year, but Looking Glass Studios unexpectedly closed down, forcing Nintendo to ultimately cancel the game, regardless of its level of completion.</p>
	<p>It is widely thought that Mini Racers was the evolution of the licensed <i><a href="#tr">Tamiya Racing 64</a></i> prototype. If true, <i>Tamiya Racing 64</i> served as a tech demo for <i>Mini Racers</i>. Certain similarities exist in the games, such as fonts, sounds, and the overall feel of the game, which makes sense as both were produced by Looking Glass Studios.</p>
	<p>Mini Racers</i> is massively more advanced than <i>Tamiya Racing 64</i>, with more modes, cars, tracks, and a softer cartoony-look. Where Tamiya went for realism, with a fixed camera angle to simulate a real-life R/C racing experience with licensed vehicles, <i>Mini Racers</i> is stripped of any real car names and adds a more arcade tracking camera to the lap-racing genre. It was also virtually finished when it was cancelled, sighted at over 90% completion.</p>
	<p>Mini Racers features three difficulty modes, 10 tracks and teams with liveries, and the choice of a generic saloon car or dune buggy rather than the bespoke licensed cars of <i>Tamiya Racing 64</i>. The teams available are Swiftline, Sportrider, Twilight, Slipstream, Mudblaster, and Darkfire, with Cyclone and Megatron left as unlockables. It also features a track creator and fully customisable Grand Prix's.</p>

	<h4>O.D.T. (Escape... Or Die Trying)</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Another game Piko Interactive picked up the rights to in April of 2020, <i>O.D.T.</i> was originally developed by FDI; it was heavily influenced by top-down run-and-gun game <i>The Chaos Engine</i> and was meant to release around the end of 1999.</p>
	<p>Two ROMs exist of the game, one for Europe and one for North America, and both are almost complete final builds of the game that simply never made it to the cartridge production stage, but the prototypes were finally dumped and released by Team Carrot in 2005. The reason it was canned in the eleventh hour before its 1999 release was due to financial issues with the parent company, and Sony bought the publisher, Psygnosis; therefore, it never got a final QA testing nor would it get published.</p>
	<p><i>O.D.T.</i> featured 40+ NPC characters with "Artificial Stupidity", four playable characters (Ike, Julia, Maxx, and Solaar), three unlockable characters (Sophia Hawkins, Karma the Ex-Deviant, and Mr. Bodybolt the 7th Passenger), sixteen spells to learn, seventy sectors to explore, as well as traps, puzzles, and boss fights bespoke to each level. There are also two endings, one good and one bad.</p>
	<p>Though the game is technically complete, it is extremely buggy, prone to crashing, and the overall movemement of the game feels sluggish, though this is possibly intentional. This clearly makes <i>O.D.T.</i> a prime candidate for Piko Interactive to fix up and cash in on at some point in the future.</p>

	<h4>RiQa</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Often touted as the N64's answer to <i>Tomb Raider</i> and hyped up as direct competition with <i>Perfect Dark</i>, <i>RiQa</i> was a third-person shooter, with puzzle and action elements thrown in. The game was presented at E3 in 1999 but cancelled in 2000 in order to focus on other games they had in production. Fresh footage of the prototype in action emerged in 2016; however, the ROM was finally released in April of 2024 by Tenshu, a former Bits Studio developer. The ROM required a fix to run on retail consoles, which was provided by <a href="https://x.com/luigiblood" target="_blank">Luigiblood</a>, and now the game is available to play on flash carts or emulators.</p>
	<p>Made by Bits Studio, along with <a href="#dh">Die Hard 64</a> and <i>Thieves World (Rogue Ops)</i>, <i>RiQa</i> was constantly delayed and pushed back due to it not reaching stringent levels of quality expected by Nintendo. During development, Nintendo oversaw a lot of the games that were in progress, and only allowed the continuation of their creation once they had attained a level of standard dubbed "Nintendo's seal of quality". Though <i>RiQa</i> couldn't get signed off in the N64-era, some ideas were later reused in Bits Studio's 2003 stealth-action game <i>Rogue Ops</i> that was released for the 6th generation consoles.</p>
	<p>The four ROM dumps for RiQa span February, March, and May of 2000 and contain the final build of the game with seven levels and two bosses to battle. Spoiler alert: it was far from a <i>Perfect Dark</i> beater, but it did have its own merits, such as the overarching story, three playable characters, and the first-person/third-person switching mechanics, that make the game quite playable.</p>
	<p>The controller settings screen has one of the weirdest-looking in-game controller models I have ever seen, but the menus that work in this build are undoubtedly inspired by <i>Perfect Dark</i>.</p>

	<h4>Robotech - Crystal Dreams</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Announced by GameTek in 1995 as <i>Robotech Academy</i> and intended to be part of the N64's release line-up, <i>Robotech - Crystal Dreams</i> was a space shooter based on the hit sci-fi anime TV series that began in 1985 and was considered one of the most anticipated launch titles at the time.</p>
	<p>The premise of Robotech was quite grand, with over 40 minutes of cinematics planned and sandbox-style open-world gameplay where you could pick and choose which missions you wanted to accept with whichever team you chose to join. Starting out as a cadet, you would work your way up the ranks through training missions and eventually graduate the titular academy using a reputation system that reflected your skill level and ability to complete missions successfully. The game would feature epic space battles with story elements in between where the player returned to their base to gather more of the story beats.</p>
	<p>Interestingly, the "Crystal Dreams" subtitle was decided on because the most complicated thing the developers could display and simulate with the 64-bit hardware was crystal-like textures and geometry, so enemies developed for the game were designed with this in mind. There were also going to be transformable Veritech fighters patrolling the cities, and you could shift between cockpit and third-person perspectives to best view the intense and graphically dazzling action-packed scenarios.</p>
	<p>Come the end of 1998, the game had been cancelled, and GameTek, having filed for bankruptcy, was acquired by Take Two Interactive. The game wouldn't see the light of day again until 2019, when it was released by Drx, who obtained the dump from Nz136z, who had previously dumped it from a 128M developer cartridge in 2018.</p>
	<p>Shockingly, the prototype contains no playable missions, but the final game was planned to have a random mission generator. Graphically, the game used clever techniques to deliver dynamic reflections, explosions, and light source shading. Robotech also featured extremely technical display elements and some incredibly complicated game concepts, which most reviewers of the time either celebrated or dismissed as confusing.</p>

	<h4>SimCopter 64</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>First developed by Maxis in 1996 and eventually shown at E3 1997, <i>SimCopter 64</i> was eventually dumped in November 2022. Notably, the game was also shown at the 1998 Tokyo Game Show, where it met harsh criticism and a general lack of interest for being boring, graphically basic, and overly foggy. These opinions ultimately lead to the demise of the title.</p>
	<p>The prototype was shown off by a Reddit user who claimed the game worked fine but was worried about corrupting the 128m+256k developer cartridge. The build date of the USA region ROM shows a date of December 1997, and the title screen contains the line "Copter64 E3", meaning this was likely a build from just a few months after it's E3 debut in May.</i>
	<p>Sadly, the game never made it off the ground, but its lineage didn't end there. <i>SimCopter 64</i> is primarily a flight simulator that sees you assume the role of a helicopter pilot who flys around helping to prevent crime, controlling traffic, moving objects, and putting out fires in career mode, or alternatively, flying around freely and taking in the scenery in user mode.</p>
	<p>Connectivity to <i>SimCity 2000</i> was rumoured to be planned, and just like it's PC counterparts, the maps you built in <i>SimCity 2000</i> would be imported into <i>SimCopter 64</i> to fly around and perform various jobs around the city, but the final outcome was to simply cancel the USA release of <i>SimCopter 64</i> altogether in 1999, and Helicopter flight was bundled into the Japanese exclusive 64DD game <i>SimCity 64</i>, ready for it's release that same year.</p> 
	<p>The game itself plays mostly like an incredibly basic vehicle simulator, and they weren't kidding about the fog; it's obscene, even for the N64! The pedestrians and service folk are 2D in the 3D world, and though there are some nice points of interest to fly around, the objectives are few and far between in this build.</p>
	<p><i>SimCopter 64</i> was also expected to have some cross-compatibility with the 64DD's Mario Artist series of games, with the mouse being used to devise maps and create scenarios as well.</p>

	<h4>Sydney 2000</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Devised by ATD and set to be published by Eidos, <i>Sydney 2000</i> was a game based on the Y2K Sydney Olympic games. Shockingly, after three years of development, the N64 version was somehow only completed several weeks <b>after</b> the Olympics' closing ceremonies had finished. Interest in the game was therefore projected to be far lower than if it had released at its peak or in anticipation of the games, and it was instantly cancelled.</p>
	<p>The Windows, Dreamcast, and PlayStation 1 versions were released just before in July, achieving 55% average reviews across all three platforms. To put it in perspective, <i>International Track and Field Summer Games</i>, which was unlicensed, released in the same month and achieved an 78% average score across multiple platforms and reviews.</p>
	<p>The first dumps appeared way back in 2010, and the final ROM was dumped on June 26th, 2017, with a build date of August 2000. It features 12 events and 32 countries, four-player support, as well as 20 mini games to train your player within its "Cyber Gym". The games presentation was described as graphically boring, and physically lacklustre by critics.</p>
	<p>The prototype is the finished final EUR build and is fully playable. I love these kinds of games; button bashing to hammer the records is where I got my first taste of competitive gaming on the PSX with International Track & Field, back in May of 1996. I seem to also remeber also playing a demo disc with it on prior to that, probably around 1995.</p>
	<p><i>Sydney 2000</i> doesn't have the same instant-enjoyment fun to it; instead, it encourages you to build your player up and train them to victory through its "Olympic" and "Coaching" modes. </p>

	<h4>Tamiya Racing 64</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>Tamiya Racing 64</i> is more likely than not, the tech demo for <a href="#mr">Mini Racers</a>. Not much is known about the game other than it was developed by Intermetrics who was associated with Looking Glass Studios at the time.</p>
	<p>The game features a variety of licensed cars, and just X tracks. The game simulates the R/C racing experience with a fixed viewpoint, and adopts a realistic colour pallette. There are just four cars available (Audi, Alpha, Mercedes, and Escort) and one track.</p>
	<p>The 128 Mbit ROM was made public on April 5th, 2012 by Team Carrot, after the developer cartridge was sold for $1,358.</p>
	<p>The game is short and sweet, covering just 8 laps before restarting itself, but you can play 4 players, </p>

	<h4>Tommy Thunder</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Originally developed in 1997 by Player1 (who originally made <i>Hercules: The Legendary Journeys</i> and <i>Robotron 64</i>) and set to be published by ASC Games, <i>Tommy Thunder</i> was a third-person action game that would see you traversing epic landscapes with a grappling hook and gunning down insect-like alien invaders in a game similar to <i>Jet Force Gemini</i>, but said to have <i>Turrican</i>, <i>Contra</i>, and <i>Metroid</i>-style gameplay mechanics.</p>
	<p>Interestingly, the prototype was not dumped from a developer cartridge; instead, it was found in 2007 on a public server that was owned by Player1, and the files "Robo64.zip" and "Tommy64.zip" were sat there for the taking. It wasn't until 2008 that the password on the zip was cracked, and the resulting ROM for <i>Tommy Thunder</i> contains an extremely early alpha build of the game from October 1997, with approximately only 5% of the overall game completed.</p>
	<p>As a run-and-gun shooter, there weren't many games of this genre on the system, and it was a natural evolution of Robotech with more 3D landscapes (like in Hercules) and more intricate gameplay. This 8 Mb alpha contains very little other than a presumably "crashed" spaceship in a green lake with mysterious extraterestrial terrain and a few purple spider-like enemies dotted around. You cannot interact with them or shoot them with your gun, nor can they do you any damage. Tommy can switch to first-person view to aim his weapon with a blue reticle, and he can leap huge heights when running and jumping, but there doesn't appear to be any direction or storyline applied to the game yet.</p>
	<p>The game switched focus from the Nintendo 64 to the OG PlayStation around 1998, but sadly never saw a release on either console. Incidentally, ASC never managed to publish a game on the N64 despite having had several in development, including a bowling game starring the Animaniacs (Player1 had previously worked on <i>Milo's Astro Lanes</i>) and a racing game starring Jeff Gordon.</p>

	<h4>Toon Panic</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Developed by Bottom Up in 2000, <i>Toon Panic</i> was going to be a fighting game with elements similar to <i>Super Smash Bros</i> including weapons, 4-player battles, and interactive arenas; but unfortunately Bottom Up shut down due to financial struggles before the game could be completed and released.</p>
	<p>The protoype first showed up in 2005 on Yahoo auctions, where it was sold for $3500. It finally showed up as a ROM in 2008 thanks to Team Carrot dumping and then releasing it to the public. Only one mode works in the available build, but the options screen contains a lot of developer options, such as sound tests, and .</p>
	<p><i>Toon Panic</i> was going to features 16 characters, single player and multiplayer modes (With AI players making up the numbers if you so wanted to), three game types (Ring Out, Crystal Smash, and Scramble), and 12 arenas (Remains, Pirate, Town, Cemetery, Church, Volcano, Roof, Forest, Pharaoh, Laputa, Cave, and Seaside).</p> 
	<p>The first thing I noticed in the game was a lot of placeholder graphics, and strangely, some of those are portraits of various characters from <i>Final Fantasty VIII</i>. The 16 characters are Golem, Knight, Merman (Zell portrait), Phenix, Mummy, Gargoyle (Irvine portrait), Witch (Edea portrait), Ghost, Priest (Rinoa portrait), Skeleton, Robot, Yeti, Dragon, and Vampire.  Seven of these are unlockable characters that are represented as "?" questionmarks in the character select screen.</i>
	<p>Only multiplayer mode is available in the prototype, and no AI is programmed yet, so the game plays at an extremely basic level. Graphically, it looks superb, with an overall aesthetic that reminds me of the <i>Powerstone</i> games.</p>

	<h4>Viewpoint 2064</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>Viewpoint 2064</i> was a vertical futuristic sci-fi shoot'em up developed by Racdym (now Racjin) of Bomberman 64 and Snowboard Kids predigree. Set to be published by Sammy Corporation, the game was touted to be released in 1999 as a spiritual successor to Sammy and SNK's 1992 isometric-shooter <i>Viewpoint</i> game in arcades and on the Neo Geo CD. I always thought games like this would start out on the Aleck64, like Seta's Variant Schwanzer arcade game. Aleck 64 was effectively built from the same 64-bit architecture but designed to be arcade hardware.</p>
	<p>First announced in 1999, the game was first shown off in August and was given a release date of the proceeding November. The release date was pushed back to "Q1 2000", then "Novermber 2000", according to outlets at the time, and ultimately it was cancelled, probably because of missed deadlines, despite being described as 100% complete and ready to go.</p>
	<p>The game features 15 stages, several elemental powerups, five bosses, and rumble pak support. The ROM was eventually dumped in March 2020 by Gaming Alexandria, having been listed and sold on eBay in 2015 for $3000.</p>
	<p>I would say that this game is 99% complete, but its a little rough. With more time in the oven it could have been a blinding shmup, but as it stands, it is fun to play for a while, until it gets repetitive.</p>

	<h4>Wildwaters: Extreme Kayak</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Here we have another Looking Glass Studio prototype, this time for the niche extreme sport of whitewater kayaking. The title went through a number of iterations before they settled on the final name. At conception in 1998, it was simply known as simply "X-Stream", and later on it was dubbed "Extreme Kayak". Due for release in 1999 and to be published by UbiSoft Entertainment, <i>Wildwaters: Extreme Kayak</i> was going to be the first of its kind for the system in terms of kayaking and the fourth of its kind whereby it required the expansion pak to play.</p>
	<p>The game would feature single-player and versus modes, with the former consisting of races with up to 4 participants. The game was proposed to have an arcade mode, time trials, a full championship mode, and "finals" mode. It was unknown how many levels it would feature, but Looking Glass crafted a water-flow system whereby any geometry could potentially be used as a level and the water would find its way through the course. The water based engine and physics were only possible thanks to the expansion pak, which would have limited the number of sales the game could have made, however, as we know, Looking Glass filed for bankruptcy before the game could release.</p>
	<p>The developer cartridge came from the same seller who shared the Tamiya Racing prototype, amd this one grossed them $1600 for the privillege. Thankfully, in 2012 Team Carrot, yet again, provided us with the ROM to check out, and there were some interesting pieces of text within, including a reference to Destruction Derby 3. It's not entirely surprising though, because Looking Glass did produce Destruction Derby 64 in 1999, just before closure, which was published by THQ under license of Psygnosis.</p>
	<p>The 128 Mbit NTSC-U ROM contains just two stages (Devil's Elbow and Woodchuck Ridge), with both single player and multiplayer modes available, and three selectable characters (Katana, Tokomo, and Tamara); however, only the single-player mode works on the Devils Elbow stage with the Katana character selected. All other combinations crash the game.</p>
	<p>While the game does run well for the one stage you can play, there is very little excitement, and the "Extreme" strapline massively falls flat in my opinion.</p>

	<h4>X'Treme Roller</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Not to be confused with being a steam roller simulation, X'Treme Roller was an inline skating game that takes inspiration from the Tony Hawks Pro Skateboarding games, but this early alpha build by Microids and Neko contains no title screen, rudimentary controls, no self-righting, and no tricks or menus implemented.</p>
	<p>The 256M/256B developer cart was dumped in December 2021 and features two playable levels (a warehouse and a seaside town; select with L-Trigger), four characters (early versions of James, Xanadu, Tinai, and Blakki; select with R-Trigger), and notably no sound or music. The ROM is 192 Mbit but contains no collision geometry for objects and virtually nothing more than two test levels.</p>
	<p>There are no buttons for jumping or doing tricks and your characters physics are yet to be implemented, so the only way to self-right if you tip over is to hit start to restart the level from the spawn point. The Seaside level is the most visually interesting and makes me think that the levels included would have been more race-based rather than trick-centric, perhaps they were street-style courses where you had to navigate through from start to end as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p>X'Treme Roller did release on the original PlayStation in 2002 with more characters (Blakki, Maewing, Anchou, Tinai, Strider, James, Xanadu, and Big Buzz), 33 stages, customisable skates and character stats, 12 tricks, grindable objects, and modes that included time trial, race, stunt competition, and bump match, as well as a tournament mode for two-player split-screen action.</p>
	<p><i>X'Treme Roller</i> got absolutely panned by players and critics for being boring to play, with very little content, and being an extremely short game.</p>

	<h4>Promising Prototypes</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>There you have it, a fine selection of prototype games (most dumped courtesy of Team Carrot) that covers a wide array of genres. Some of these games need to have a resurgeance; they simply do not deserve to die here; they have too much character and soul to never see the light of day again!</p>
	<p>In producing this article, I took time to play and screenshot each one individually. In doing so, I was able to appreciate each game for how they felt as well as how they played. I would highly encourage anyone interested in these games to give them a go, and on an actual N64 too (via flash cart), because playing on emulators is convenient, but a lot of the effects are lost, the flow of the game can feel entirely different, and in most cases, it's far more enjoyable and infinitely more nostalgic to get stuck into these on a real console.</p>
	<p>There are a plethora of games that had prototypes that did release, but they were either missing proposed features or they were entirely different types of games altogether. My upcoming articles will go into some of those games very soon!</p>
