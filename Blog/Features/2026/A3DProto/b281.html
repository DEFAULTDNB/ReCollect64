	<h4>Historic Hues</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Following the last batch of <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b253">Funtastic variations</a>, Analogue has once again branched out and offered new colourways for their 4K FPGA rendition of the Nintendo 64.</p>
	<p>The prototype selection offers a glimpse into the possible colours Nintendo considered using to craft their 64-bit consoles but never ran with, according to official historical documents detailing production choices.</p>

	<h4>More the Merrier?</h4>

	<p>Though these options reflect a really cool and niche era of the Nintendo 64's development, I can't help but feel a little annoyed that these aren't presented as swappable shells. The fact that I bought my console at launch means that I will not be double dipping and will probably never get to enjoy these unique and interesting variants for myself.</p>
	<p>Had Analogue gone down the route of swappable shells, as <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b243">Mod Retro's M64</a> is doing, I probably would have been a little happier to see these. As it stands, Analogue consistantly disappoints me. I'm still awaiting the proposed, <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b198">and demonstrated</a>, screenshot and Wi-Fi features on the heavily delayed, but now 3-month-old console.</p>
