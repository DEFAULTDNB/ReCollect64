	<h4>Historic Hues</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Following the last batch of <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b253">Funtastic variations</a>, Analogue has once again branched out and offered new colourways for their 4K FPGA rendition of the Nintendo 64. 8BitDo, as ever, have also followed suit and shown off the matching 8BitDo 64 controllers.</p>
	<p>The prototype selection offers a glimpse into the possible colours Nintendo considered using to craft their 64-bit consoles but never ran with, according to official historical documents detailing production choices.</p>

	<h4>More the Merrier?</h4>

	<p>Though these options reflect a really cool and niche era of the Nintendo 64's development, I can't help but feel a little annoyed that these aren't presented as swappable shells. The fact that I bought my console at launch means that I will not be double dipping and will probably never get to enjoy these unique and interesting variants for myself.</p>
	<p>Had Analogue gone down the route of swappable shells, as <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b243">Mod Retro's M64</a> is doing, I probably would have been a little happier to see these. As it stands, Analogue consistantly disappoints me. I'm still awaiting the proposed, <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b198">and demonstrated</a>, screenshot and Wi-Fi features on the heavily delayed, but now 3-month-old console.</p>
