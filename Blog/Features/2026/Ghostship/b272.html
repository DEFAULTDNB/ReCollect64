	<p>Since <i>Super Mario 64</i> was first fully decompiled in August 2019 and ported to PC in May of 2020, a plethora of mods, hacks and improvements have come into existence thanks to the diligent efforts of the N64Decomp team and the numerous contributors who have had a hand in its evolution.</p>
	<p>Last night, the Harbour Masters 64, led by <a href="https://github.com/kiritodv">KiritoDv</a>, stepped in to show off their latest offering, a modern PC port of <i>Super Mario 64</i> that embodies everything catalogue of N64 ports have to offer!</p>

	<h4>Formidable Features</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>Ghostship</i>'s first release, amusingly dubbed Dutchman Alfa, has an ethos towards ease of use and modern features you have come to expect from the high-quality releases that originate from the HM64 camp. The current release is for Windows and macOS, with Linux and Nintendo Switch planned, and Android sure to follow as soon as feasible.</p>
	<p>With 60+ FPS, <a href="https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Ghostship">custom textures, cheats, mods</a>, level select, and more, this release is essentially a much-needed update to the now 6-year-old existing PC ports frameworks, bringing it bang up-to-date and reinvigorating the N64 PC port scene once again.</p>
	<p>You need to either provide your own US ROM (MD5: 9BEF1128717F958171A4AFAC3ED78EE2BB4E86CE) or the Japanese ROM (MD5: 8A20A5C83D6CEB0f0506CFC9FA20D8F438CAFE51) to enjoy this release. Simply drop the ROM in the extracted folder, and let the executable do its thing, generating the sm64.o2r file!</p>
