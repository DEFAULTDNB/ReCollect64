	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The NFL Blitz Resurrection team recently tweeted for the first time since November with an announcement that NFL Blitz 2026 Gold Edition was coming on February the 2nd, 2026. Well, today is February the 2nd, and the ROM hack has been released for all to enjoy in time for the NFL's Super Bowl LX!</p>
	<p>The last version of NFL Blitz Gold Edition was released for 2024's season and contained a new Blitz 2024 logo, Super Bowl-themed title screens and updated end-of-season rosters and ratings. As a bonus, players with season-ending injuries were also put back in the game.</p>

	<h4>Super Bowl, Super Fans</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The last official game was <i>NFL Blitz 2000</i>, which was released exclusively for North America in 1999, but the community has driven the series as up to date as possible by crafting incremental annual versions that update player names, rosters, jerseys, teams and more.</p>
	<p>Officially, there is no known decompilation project for this game, at least none that I could locate publicly; however, after updating the front page of this site, I have had multiple requests for the <i>NFL Blitz</i> series of games to get the PC port and recompilation treatment. If anyone has any further information on this matter, please feel free to let me know, because there is a lot of fan interest!</p>
