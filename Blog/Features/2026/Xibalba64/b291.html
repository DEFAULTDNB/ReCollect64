	<h4>Beautiful Blasters</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>A fresh first-person shooter with visuals akin to <i>Doom</i> is destined for the 64-bit system thanks to its developer, Phoboslab, aka Dominic Szablewski.</p>
	<p><i>Xibalba</i>, a WebGL FPS, was built using JavaScript on top of the author's own HTML 5 game engine, named Impact, back in 2014, and after more than a decade, it is being natively ported to the Nintendo 64 for even more players to enjoy.</p>
