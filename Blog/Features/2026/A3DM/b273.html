	<h4>Storage Superstars</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The Analogue 3D has been in our hands since the end of November 2025, but since then, there hasn't been much in the way of firmware updates, mods or anything interesting for the FPGA console, other than <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b242">compatibility fixes</a> for flash carts such as the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b241">EverDrive 64</a>.</p>
	<p>Today Meowser77 has released the first Analogue 3D file manager, a web-based SD card management tool which can help back up, organise and tweak all of the settings on your Analogue 3D's internal storage. The only caveat is that you must use a Chrome-based browser to use the tools, as this is currently only available as a progressive web app.</p>

	<p><b>What can it do?</b></p>
	<p>For those who missed the first post, this tool is designed to take the headache out of organizing your SD card. You can definitely do this stuff manually, but the Ul makes it much faster.</p>
	<p>• Label Management: You can edit artwork locally and hit a global "Sync Now" button to update the cartridge artwork on your Analogue 3D.</p>
	<p>• Controller Pak/Save Management: Create annotated backups of your controller paks.</p>
	<p>• Per-Game Settings: A Ul to manage Display and Hardware settings for specific cartridges without digging through config files. Copy and paste settings between games.</p>
	<p>• Backups: You can export specific cartridge data or do a full dump of your settings from the interface.</p>
	<p>• Offline: This is a progressive web app, so you can download it from Chrome and run it offline if that happens to be helpful for you.</p>
	<p>If you're happy managing your SD card manually, you don't need this. But if you've got a big collection, want to back things up properly, or just want a nicer interface for tweaking per-game settings, hopefully it's useful.</p>
	<p>Still very much a work in progress. If you run into issues or have ideas, the open source version of this project repo is still open: https://github.com/TheLeggett/A3D-Manager</p>
	<p>Thanks to everyone who gave feedback on the first version.</p>

	<h4>Artwork Adjustments</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Along with the ability to back up game paks, settings and labels succinctly, as well as beautifully monitoring your current storage capacity, this manager also allows you to customise your cartridge art without the need for any additional database tools or image editing software. It comes bundled with 340+ Analogue 3D cart IDs mapped and annotated, ready for use.</p>
	<p>By simply draging and droping images into the upload box (in PNG, JPG or WebP format), it will automatically resize the files to the required 74x86 pixel format, displaying a side-by-side preview of current and new labels. You can also customise names for any homebrew apps or flash carts as well, and it can all be run offline too.</p>
	<p>This project is ongoing, and the author is reaching out to the A3D community to supply feedback and ideas, as well as leaving the project open source so that you can modify or reimplement it as you wish. Hopefully we will see alternative stand-alone versions that aren't Chrome-dependent spawn from this fantastically useful project. Currently only Chrome uses the File System Access API, so other browsers are not supported.</p>
