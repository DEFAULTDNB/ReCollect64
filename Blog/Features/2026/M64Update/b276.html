	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Thanks to signing up for the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b176">earlybird offers from the previous announcements</a>, an update email has just hit my inbox by way of Torin from ModRetro. The email details several long-awaited details regarding the FPGA machine and its various colourways.</p>
	<p>The email comes complete with a couple of interesting images, a survey link for those who signed up, and some interesting tidbits that are helping me to very much look forward to the machine's release in the wake of the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r90">Analogue 3D's markedly lukewarm reception</a>.</p>

	<p>Hey it’s Torin, CEO of ModRetro.</p>
	<p>It’s about time we send out an M64 update, so let’s jump right in.</p>
	<p>Early production is almost done. Soon we’re moving into mass production, with some of those early production units going out to reviewers to take them for a test drive.</p>
	<p>With that in mind, we need your help:</p>
	<p>Please take a look at the attached images of our three four colorways (we’ve officially decided to also offer red at launch!) and take this survey on which one you’ll be ordering. This will help us ensure you get the color you want, as we start shipping in a few months.</p>
	<p>Now, more about M64. It contains one of the most special PCBAs in any consumer hardware that we know of. Black pre-preg and a clear soldermask with gold traces. See image below. There is a reason you never see this – it’s expensive and takes forever, but the result is truly beautiful.</p>
	<p>M64 will boot into gameplay in 4-5 seconds and contains an ultra low latency bluetooth device which pairs with our wired/wireless ultimate trident controller, which will come shortly after M64.</p>
	<p>M64 is full of mechanical easter eggs. A hot pink hidden latch under the cartridge flaps can optionally keep them open all the time. An easy eject mechanism allows you to eject the cartridge without pulling the console off the ground. A special light pipe will uplight the cartridge so you can see your game art in the dark.</p>
	<p>As you have come to expect from us, we will be continually working at a rapid pace on firmware after the device ships, and will tell you what’s in the pipeline as we go.</p>

	<p>We’ll be sharing more information about M64 soon.</p>
	<p>Get excited. Dust off those cartridges. More to come.</p>
	<p>– Torin</p>
	<p>P.S. Here’s a link to that survey again – it shouldn’t take more than 2 minutes to complete and will help us make sure we make enough of every color.</p>

	<h4>Informative Innards</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>ModRetro appears to be directly taking shots at the only current competitor, the Analogue 3D, by stating that they're going to be releasing the device in four colourways, with a "light pipe" that illuminates the cartridge art, an easy eject mechanism, hidden Easter eggs within the PCB, and that it will boot directly into a game within 4-5 seconds.</p>
	<p>Early revisions of the hardware are currently in the hands of testers, and going off their feedback, mass production should commence soon. A solid release date for the M64 is still unannounced.</p>
	<p>If you would like to receive the survey link, which is only for 4-5 short multiple-choice questions, then please sign up on the ModRetro site for access.</p>
