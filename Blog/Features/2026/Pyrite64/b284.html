	<h4>AIO Game Dev Kit</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Python developer and GitHub project hype-man Tom Doerr has today teased a new N64 game engine and editor made by Max Bebök (HailToDodongo) and Kevin R. (Byterset) which harnesses the power of Libdragon SDK, an open-source Software Development Kit, and tiny3d which, is described as <i>N64 3D ucode for Libdragon</i>, to build homebrew games for the nearly 30-year-old 64-bit hardware.</p>

	<p><b>Installing Pyrite64</b></p>
	<p>Pyrite64 comes as a self-contained installation for the editor and engine.</p>
	<p>The only thing external is the N64-SDK, which depending on the platform, can be auto-installed for you by the editor.</p>
	<p><b>Windows and Linux</b></p>
	<p>Download the latest prebuilt version from GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/HailToDodongo/pyrite64/actions">https://github.com/HailToDodongo/pyrite64/actions</a>.</p>
	<p>Extract the ZIP file on your PC in any directory you want.</p>
	<p>Inside, launch pyrite64.exe (or pyrite64 on linux) to start the editor.</p>
	<p>On the first start you will see a message that it could not find any N64 toolchain.</p>
	<p>By clicking on the "Install Toolchain" button you can open the toolchain manager.</p>
	<p>This will walk your through the process of installing it, most of which is fully automated.</p>
	<p>Once that part is done, you now have two new options to either open or create a new project.</p>
	<p><b>Creating a new Project</b></p>
	<p>As a test if everything has installed correctly, you can create a new project.</p>
	<p>Simply click on "Create Project" and choose a name.</p>
	<p>Once in the editor, press F12 to build the default project.</p>
	<p>This should then succeed and produce a .z64 ROM in the project directory.</p>
	<p>Note that the first build can take a little bit longer, since the included engine gets compiled once.</p>

	<h4>Game Jam Champ</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>If you recognise the name Max Bebök (HailToDodongo), that might be because of his tireless contributions to the annual N64Brew Game Jam contests. <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b72">Last year he dropped the superb Coin Rush</a>, which placed first, and the $1754 winnings were distributed to the Alzheimer's Association.</p>
	<p>Pyrite64 was devised to enable people to build interesting homebrew for the aforementioned contests, and Coin Rush is a prime example of the ability of the SDK and the templates provided for entrants to get their projects up and running quickly. Though this new toolset is currently not ready for prime time, the source code is available, and contributions can be made towards it in order to get it up and ready for general use.</p>
