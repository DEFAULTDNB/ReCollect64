	<h4>Premium Preamble</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When the Analogue 3D was released there were but two options: white or black. I, the discerning Nintendo 64 connoisseur opted for the black variant because it most closely resembled the OG N64 hardware, and I've never been a huge fan of white consoles due to inevitable yellowing and dust/residue build-up on buttons and places you commonly interact with the device.</p>
	<p>Having received my order on <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b237">the 24th of November 2025</a>, I was quite literally fuming to discover that, having waited over a year to get my hands on it, they immediately announced a line of 8 vibrant <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b253">Funtastic variants</a> merely two weeks later. To add insult to injury, two months after the Funtastics, they announced five utterly gorgeous <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b281">prototype colours</a>.</p>
	<p>I can see what Analogue are doing, they're creating reasons for people to purchase multiple times. Thankfully, FOMO will not get me. I can see through the ruse, and until the software that was promised is finally fully delivered, I would advise anyone to think twice about purchasing one, unless you're a serious hardware hoarder.</p>

	<p>As mentioned above, unless you have excess wads of money knocking about in your home, the average person, including myself, will not be double-dipping on the £250 FPGA. Though the colour options are now incredibly varied and, in some cases, jaw-droppingly good-looking, there isn't a chance in heck that I will be purchasing another one anytime soon.</p>
	<p>That said, to satiate my OCD-ness for absorbing all the possible options side-by-side, I have chosen to visually rank the available selection and give my personal opinion as to why I think these are either top tier, middle of the road, or just plain trash. Without further ado, here's what I deem to be the first all the way through to the worst. Enjoy!</p>

		<h4>[Prototype] - Ghost:</h4>
		<p>When it comes to the unreleased colours that Nintendo considered using during the lifetime of the Nintendo 64, this one "Ghost", is the epitome of cool. The opaque "sea glass" effect and subtle hint of bluey-green within its colouration, elevate this version above all others, at least in my eyes.</p>
		<p>If only we could go back in time and force uncle Shiggsy to choose this style instead of those wonky, non-symmetrical, horrendously gimmicky and gaudy Pikachu consoles.</p>

		<h4>[Prototype] - Ocean:</h4>
		<p>Another new entry into the N64 family is the Ocean Blue prototype model. This deep sapphire blue is luxurious and alluring, easily so much better than "midnight blue" which just turns out to be "grape purple" if you look at it in the right light.</p>
		<p>I suppose this colourway was too close to ice blue and "midnight blue" that Nintendo couldn't warrant attempting to push out another blue on the unsuspecting Y2K-fearing public. Personally, if they had made this colour, I probably would have purchased it without question.</p>

		<h4>[FUNTASTIC] - Jungle Green:</h4>
		<p>A fan favourite and an easy pick for the top three, it's Jungle Green. Synonymous with the phenomenally enticing NTSC-U <i>Donkey Kong 64</i> bundle with the yellow cart, the see-through green console has always been the pick of the bunch.</p>
		<p>Of the six funtastics in this list, the green one is always the one I find that most people either owned or wanted. It would be fascinating to see a statistical breakdown of exactly how many of each colour were sold around the world before the end of the 64-bit console's life cycle.</p>

		<h4>[PROTOTYPE] - Extreme Green:</h4>
		<p>As a child of Europe, I never saw anything "Extreme Green" for the Nintendo 64 in the UK. When I started collecting consoles and games almost 20 years ago, I discovered that the Extreme Green variant controller existed, and it has forever been on my want list.</p>
		<p>Analogue are said to have spent a year in pre-production colour matching these consoles to the ones Nintendo were considering using. If this matches the controller, I would be willing to bet that this colour will be quite high up on the most wanted list for those who already own matching pads.</p>
		<p>Personally, I think it's the right level of nostalgic day-glow neon. It takes me back to a simpler time. I love it.</p>

		<h4>[FUNTASTIC] - Smoke Grey:</h4>
		<p>Smoke Grey has always been a superior shade when it comes to technology. The mixture of sleek black and transparent shell gives just enough away of the internal gubbins while maintaining a nice silhouette on the shelf.</p>
		<p>If this had been an option for day one A3D purchasers, such as myself, I would have snapped this one up over the plain black or white in a heart-beat. It's just so understated and undeniably stylish!</p>
		<p>True story: my Smoke Grey N64 is in pristine condition, having been kept in my loft, but the controller has yellowed hideously, having been kept out in my external and chilly garage. 'Gutted' doesn't even cover it. I guess I'll need to procure another!</p>

		<h4>[PROTOTYPE] - Glacier:</h4>
		<p>Glacier is such a great-sounding tone, but in reality it's a shade or two different from the Ghost prototype, yet somehow it's slightly less visually appealing. Glacier reminds me of the bottom halves of the limited edition Jusco consoles or the clear white/red and clear white/blue Funtastics.</p>
		<p>While it is still a relatively refreshing variant, it doesn't quite have the aura the other variants listed above manage to farm. It's not as weak-looking as the clear variant, but it's also not as polished as ghost. It's a middle-of-the-road variant, and I can understand why Nintendo didn't push it forward for production.</p>

		<h4>[FUNTASTIC] - Ice Blue:</h4>
		<p>This one, above all others, reminds me of Apple's iMac aesthetic of the late 90s. The fun, vibrant, daring colours went against the grain of the typically light or dark grey that 99% of home PCs and consoles were composed of and ran in a whole other direction that lit up your shelves.</p>
		<p>The saturated blue complexion also reminds me of <i>Wave Race 64</i>, a game that could have easily been the perfect title to champion this tropical ocean-coloured edition. I always wonder why Nintendo didn't produce more tie-in bundles or promotional offers to reinvigorate sales of <i>Wave Race 64</i>; after all, there were three years in between the release of the game and this perfectly-suited colour being made available.</p>
		<p>Proceeding jungle green and smoke grey, this is definitely one of my personal faves within the OG cluster, it's just so icey-cool!</p>

		<h4>[FUNTASTIC] - Fire Orange:</h4>
		<p>A classic colour and a solid choice for most people I knew back in the noughties. Everyone seemed to want the jungle green but only managed to snag a fire orange as second best. I'm not sure why this was the case, but regardless, it's a nice warm colour up close.</p>
		<p>Orange, as a tint, can be a little polarising. On one hand it's an exciting autuminal shade that rests in the safe space between red and yellow, but on the other hand, it can feel too intense or even jarring. I think Analogue have nailed the OG orange, but do people really like it?</p>
		<p>I imagine F-Zero X could have been a great candidate to pair with this coloured hardware back in the day because of its blistering speed and death-defying game modes.</p>

		<p>I have to admit, when I first saw this colour, I thought it was really nice, but not quite right for my technological palette. I don't know any one single person who owned the Watermelon variety N64, so I can't envisage the masses clamouring for this one as an FPGA.</p>
		<p>A powerful and emotionally charged hue, I don't think that watermelon is particularly well enjoyed in the UK, so by association with the fruit, not many people were drawn to this shade, especially when jungle green, ice blue and fire orange also existed.</p>
		<p>Which games could this have been associated with? How about <i>Banjo-Kazooie/Tooie</i> to keep it child-friendly, or perhaps <i>Perfect Dark</i> for the 18+ demographic?</p>

		<h4>[FUNTASTIC] - Grape Purple/Midnight Blue:</h4>
		<p>The main reason this one sits slightly below the other funtastics is twofold. Firstly, I'm not a huge fan of anything purple (wait until you see where Atomic Purple is placed), and secondly, you cannot call it "Grape Purple" in the Americas and Europe but then call it "Midnight Blue" in Japan. I mean, if Nintendo couldn't decide, then which was it?</p>
		<p>As part of the set of six core funtastics, it's a decent colour with more depth than other "purple"-named variants, but it's a fence-sitting colour that could have been done far better, as the ocean prototype demonstrates. I guess a purple one was needed to bridge the spectrum between red and the possible release of ocean, but sadly this one misses the brief in my opinion.</p>
		<p>Could it have been paired up with a game to reinvigorate sales? Had they truly nailed the "purple" I could see this selling wildly with <i>Majora's Mask</i>. All it would have taken is a bit more red in the mixture and a logo on the expansion cover!</p>

		<h4>[SPECIAL] - Gold Edition:</h4>
		<p>I own an OG Japanese Gold Edition N64 console, and I use it as my daily driver. I have no real idea why I opted to use it above all the others I own, but I do. This A3D effigy is pretty spot-on to the original colour, which was a limited edition Toys R Us console in both Japan and America, but nowadays, I can't help but feel that it looks a little too much.</p>
		<p>I can't think of many other consoles that could pull off the gold aesthetic, barring my <i>Majoras Mask</i> Nintendo 3DS, which is glossy as well as golden. This console, however, is more matte than glossy, which is probably a better choice than full-on metallic reflective gold, but it's somehow still a little bland compared to the other colours available.</p>
		<p>Perhaps if Nintendo had released Zelda special edition consoles, with emblems and finesse, this N64 would look much nicer and would exude more character. <i>Killer Instinct Gold</i> missed a trick with a gold cart and a gold console bundle too!</p>

		<h4>[FUNTASTIC] - Atomic Purple:</h4>
		<p>This variant is one of my least favourites as far as the transparent Funtastic look goes. I feel like it's easily the weakest of the additional Funtastics, if you count Jungle, Smoke, Ice, Watermelon, Fire and Grape as the first wave, and Extreme Green and Atomic Purple as a second wave.</p>
		<p>Atomic purple also isn't very "atomic". There's no glow about it, no depth and no redeeming vibrance. Instead it's unexciting and uninteresting, where the extravagant naming would suggest otherwise.</p>
		<p>They should have named this "Sun-faded OAP Home Lavender" and not tried to amp up any excitement over it by using the word "Atomic". I have seen far nicer purple-coloured tech in recent years, and where "grape" also didn't hit the purple notes (it's pretty much blue), this one falls so much shorter; it's laughable.</p>

		<h4>[MODERN] - Black:</h4>
		<p>While I chose this colour for my console (because no other colours existed until just TWO WEEKS after I received mine), I'm still a bit bitter about it. It's not "Charcoal Grey" as the original console was; instead, it's a flat black, which looks clean but doesn't outwardly evoke any nostalgia through the colour alone.</p>
		<p>I can see why Analogue chose black as a poster child for the preorder campaign, because it's modern, sleek and minimal, but if they hadn't released EIGHT additional colours so quickly, I probably wouldn't have such remorse for not waiting it out a bit longer.</p>
		<p>Why didn't Analogue make a grey variant day one? Why didn't they tell us preorder customers that other options were coming so soon, or give us the option to switch? It's greed. The reason is greed.</p>

		<h4>[MODERN] - White:</h4>
		<p>While I'm not a fan of white consoles, I can see the appeal for people who are looking to match their consoles together across generations. The white variant of the A3D is clean and crisp and still doesn't quite edge out the black one for me, even upon reflection of the purchase.</p>
		<p>I hate the idea that this colour will age and turn yellow. I know it's not guaranteed, and plastics these days are probably better at handling years of handling and light exposure, but regardless, this thing is going to get heinously filthy the quickest.</p>
		<p>If it's not general day-to-day dust and dirt, it's greasy fingers, sticky fingers, or something knocking into it and causing a scuff or scrape that's going to ruin that pristine look instantly. I'm not here for that.</p>

		<h4>[PROTOTYPE] - Clear:</h4>
		<p>I'm going to say it outright; I don't like this variant at all. I could see that some might like this look, but there are far nicer variants out there that achieve this look but in a more appealing way. Smoke black for one!</p>
		<p>I get the idea behind it, being able to see the components within the shell, but my goodness, what a boring set of giblets it has. Even the OG N64 is quite visually uninteresting until you remove the heat spreader, but this iteration just highlights the ports on the back and the fan/heatsink.</p>
		<p>I think if clear shells are to exist, perhaps the subject matter within should be purposefully annotated or exaggerated visually in some way. I'm glad that Nintendo didn't run with this. Some things just don't need to be transparent, and in my opinion, the A3D is one of them.</p>

	<h4>Ranking Wrapped up</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Well there you have it, 15 flavours of 4K FPGA in one neat tier system. Each colour is subjective, because we know that beauty lies within the eye of the beholder, but some will stand far more popular than others, and my opinion is just the humble ramblings of an individual who happens to be an N64 fanatic.</p>
	<p>At the end of the day Analogue are not making any friends with OG purchasers by releasing so many so quickly, and it stings to think just how great some of these look and that I cannot simply purchase a shell or something to easily customise the console I purchased into the colour I desire. Rest assured, I won't be <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b259">spray painting</a> mine.</p>
