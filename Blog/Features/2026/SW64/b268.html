	<h4>Grand Theft Mushroom</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Kaze Emanuar has released his latest transformational <i>Super Mario 64</i> ROM hack which, almost unbelievably, is a first-person shooting, stock-trading, roguelike which harnesses the almost 30 year old platforming title's engine and transforms it into what can only be described as a full-on gang war-fuelled <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>-like experience!</p>
	<p>Like a fever dream, Kaze has turned the edgy 2009 parody YouTube videos where Mario and Luigi take a wrong turn and end up in Vice City into a fully loaded hack that was inspired by the text-based 1984 IBM PC game <i>Drug Wars</i>. Check out the details below!</p>
	<div class="container">
	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i>
	<p>Become a millionaire in this first person, stock trading roguelike.</p>
	<p>Please note that the control scheme is made for an original N64 controller - the stick is used for aiming here.</p>

	<p>Fighting gangs, fending off the police, and managing resources and manipulating stock prices through insider trading aside, there is already a competition being held on Kaze's Discord server:</p>
	<p>If you think you have what it takes to master this roguelite ROM hack, then please get involved ASAP. The highest score will be announced on February 17th, and the winner will pocket $250 of real-life wonga.</p>
	<p>I will be casting my views on this awesome-looking modification in the coming days, with a full review as soon as I can eke out some time (plus I'll be submitting my scores to the Discord channel linked below), so keep your eyes peeled for that.</p>
