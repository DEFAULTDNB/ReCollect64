	<p><a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp/">Nintendo 64 recompilation</a> projects are coming thick and fast in 2026, and with it being just the very beginning of February, we already have our next candidate by way of Cellenseres' version of <i>Space Station Silicon Valley</i>: Recompiled!</p>
	<p>This recomp is based on the ongoing <a href="https://sssv.deco.mp/"><i>Space Station Silicon Valley</i> Decompilation</a> effort, which sits at <b>96%</b> of functions decompiled and roughly <b>77%</b> of bytes completed out of the 127120-byte ROM. As we know, a complete decompilation is not always required in order to produce a working recompilation, but it certainly helps with fully annotated code and labelled functions.</p>

	<p>Though the game has been demonstrated running well with modern controls and just a handful of graphical bugs left to iron out, the release hasn't been made public just yet. Perhaps Cellenseres is waiting to polish it up more, or perhaps implement more features such as high FPS or ultrawide screen compatibility.</p>
	<p>I will be avidly watching the progress of this one, as it was one of my absolute faves to mess around with in 1998 on the Nintendo 64. DMA, now known as Rockstar North, definitely used this game as an exploratory stepping-stone by experimenting with open-world 3D graphics, clever mechanics and a variety of animals with unique power-ups.</p>
	<p>I have added this recomp's links to the front page, and updated this post with the latest release, please see below!</p>
