	<h4>Get Revved up!</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Dead Hamster and the OverKart 64 Community are hosting their annual custom <i>Mario Kart 64</i> track building contest, and they are looking for new and exciting entrants to produce some fresh tracks for the now 29-year-old racing classic.</p>
	<p>This will be the third annual event, but this time around, to spice things up, there's going to be a theme to the entries. "Wonders of the world" is the design brief, and this opens up a lot of scope for people to capture some of the planet's natural, modern or ancient, iconic landmarks!</p>

	<h4>Annual Awards</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The creative contest is due to end around the beginning of April, so there is plenty of time to take up tools such as <a href="https://github.com/DeadHamster35/Tarmac64">Tarmac 64</a> to get in good stead to compete for those cash prizes. If you think you have what it takes, then please enter; the more the merrier!</p>
	<p>Following the creative side of the contest, the competitive side will immediately kick in and racers will be tasked with setting the best times over the newly crafted terrains.</p>
