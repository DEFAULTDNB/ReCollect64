	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Almost 16 months after the initial news that <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b20">Jnmartin84 and Co's <i>Super Mario 64</i> Dreamcast port was underway</a>, the team are back with a nice new update that addresses all the outstanding issues thanks to the incredible progress made and features added to their ports of <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b185"><i>Mario Kart 64</i></a> and, most recently, <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b251"><i>Star Fox 64</i></a>.</p>
	<p>Teased back in December, Falco Girgis explained that the team have harnessed a lot of gains to bring across the most cohesive and feature-rich port possible. They're also utilising an update to the original 2020 Dreamcast port of <i>SM64</i> by <a href="https://github.com/mrneo240/sm64-port">mrneo240</a>, which addresses the audio-visual issues that were present and adds VMU saving as well as 480p support. Dreamcast afficionados will finally get to experience a virtually flawless <i>SM64</i> native port for their beloved Sega console, thanks to the tireless work of this astonishing team.</p>

	<p>While checking Jnmartin84's GitHub repo, it's interesting to see that <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b261"><i>Harvest Moon 64</i></a> has been <a href="https://github.com/jnmartin84/hm64-decomp">added</a> alongside the already known <a href="https://github.com/jnmartin84/DukeNukemZeroHour"><i>Duke Nukem: Zero Hour</i></a> decompilation, which was used in <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b224">SonicDcer's WIP recompilation for PC</a>.</p>
	<p>I'm looking forward to more N64 decompilation projects bearing fruit and yet more of these amazing PC and Sega Dreamcast ports hitting the scene throughout 2026!</p>
