	<h4>Project Reality</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Building on the cumulative <a href="https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark">Perfect Dark decompilation efforts</a>, Flat2VR has today shared that developer and modder Alex LeTux has managed to recompile Rare's stealth action shooter into a full-on, living, breathing virtual reality experience which appears to work on Android-powered headsets such as the Meta Quest 3.</p>

	<h4>Perfect Potential</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With this immersive concept proving to be so tantalising for fans of the game, it begs the question: "Can more PC-portable decomps be built into VR games?" This gets me thinking that games such as <i>Mario Kart 64, Super Mario 64, Star Fox 64</i>, and the <i>Zelda</i> PC ports, could at the very least take advantage of stereoscopic 3D rather than immersive 3D.</p>
	<p>First-person shooters such as <i>GoldenEye 007, Duke Nukem 64, Doom 64, Shadowgate, Turok 3</i>, and even <i>Virtual Pool</i> (all of which have in-progress decompilations in the works) could hugely benefit from being given an additional dimension and become truly transformative experiences.</p>
