	<h4>Decompiled Demake</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As unbelievable as this sounds, yesterday, Ebonura, aka Bonnie Games, aka software engineer and game developer Manny, teased us with a work-in-progress video and source code for his upcoming <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> PlayStation 1 port.</p>
	<p>While it might sound like another fever dream, this project follows in the footsteps of <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b235">Malucard's <i>Super Mario 64</i> PSX port</a>, shown back in November, in turning the decompiled source code of the 64-bit games into living, breathing 32-bit recreations!</p>

	<p>Following up from my recent Celeste port for PICO-8, here's a very early-stage look at how Zelda: Ocarina of Time may look on the PS1. Here running on DuckStation. Collision detection and basic movement work, but there are tons of graphical glitches still. I did get a Souls-like camera working though, right analog stick orbits, left analog moves, hold Circle to sprint.</p>
	<p>Not sure if running the entire game is even doable. I know sm64-psx exists and I've been studying its code, but OOT is a significantly more complex game. I'll keep you posted if I have some news.</p>
	<p>For obvious reasons I cannot share the built disc image. GitHub contains the instructions to build this yourself, you'll need a MIPS cross-compiler toolchain, mkpsxiso, and an OoT NTSC 1.2 ROM to extract the assets from, all info in the README.</p>
	<p>May I remind you that you need an original copy of the game to dump the ROM legally.</p>

	<h4>Sorry Sony Squires</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>This project is by no means a guarantee that the full final game will ever be ported to OG PlayStation hardware, but it certainly maintains the rather interesting dialogue as to whether it is feasible to see any 64-bit-era games scaled down and reconfigured for the 32-bit system. </p>
	<p>The fact that the decompiled code can be used as a basis is a fantastic start and paves the way for assets and geometry to be utilsed quickly; however, it still requires a massive amount of tooling, optimisation and creativity to get something remotely playable, let alone complete, to be possible within the constraints of the system's specifications and abilities.</p>
	<p>As ever, I will be following this project closely and hoping for the best for the author. If you would like to support Manny's efforts, please head over to his <a href="https://bonnie-games.itch.io/">Itch.io</a> site today!</p>
