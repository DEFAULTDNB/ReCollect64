	<p>20-year-old Canadian <i>Super Mario 64</i> speedrunner and streamer <a href="https://x.com/greensuigi">Suigi</a> has issued a challenge to the community in an attempt to shake up his own stranglehold across not one but five major speedrunning titles in the classic 64-bit platformer.</p>
	<p>So confident in his skills, he is offering an increasingly tempting lump sum of $1000 (which might grow with crowdfunding), to the first person who can topple his 5/5 status. This means just one winner, the "first runner to end my reign of 5/5", who can beat any one single category, could take that prize and the kudos that comes with it.</p>

	<h4>Star Performer</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Suigi currently holds the titles for 0 Star: 0:06:14 (Dec 2025), 1 Star: 0:06:53 (set early 2026), 16 Star: 0:14:35 (Nov 2024), 70 Star: 0:46:26 (Nov 2024), and 120 Star: 1:35:28 (Oct 2024). For someone to hold multiple-length speedrun titles is almost unheard of, but here we stand in 2026, with just one person holding the lot and feeling wrestless at a lack of competition.</p>
	<p>If you own an OG N64 (not an emulator or FPGA system) and think you have the minerals, then please enter! It's about time someone knocked Suigi off the top spot and took home a well-deserved $1000+ cash prize.</p>
