	<p>It might sound utterly far-fetched, but several days ago an interesting video surfaced which demonstrated how to connect your Nintendo 64 to a PS2 and play cooperatively within a specially crafted <i>Super Mario 64</i> ROM hack that outputs Mario's position and movements.</p>
	<p>Professional modder Carl Llewellyn (Carl Does Tech Things) utilised a <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r7">PicoCart64</a> as well as a Rust server with Golang as a translator to achieve the feat, which allows you to play against other players who are connected to the same server.</p>
	<p>Crucially, the Nintendo 64 is not technically "online"; rather the development cartridge outputs information, which is interpreted by a custom server and fed into another copy of the game running on another platform on the same server.</p>

	<h4>Custom Communications</h4>

	<p>This isn't the first time that Carl has Frankenstein'ed together the Nintendo 64 and another console to play online. Five months ago, he connected the N64 via PicoCart to an original PlayStation console to create a weird mash-up of <i>Crash Bandicoot</i> and </i>Super Mario 64</i> through the PS1's serial port, where controlling Crash amusingly controlled a Goomba in SM64.</p>

	<p>Technically, any game that has been fully decompiled could see similar treatment if anyone was interested enough to map all of the positional data and movements of each player, so games like <i>Mario Kart 64</i> could potentially see a similar thing happen, but it's no easy task. In addition, once the work is done, you and any other interested parties would each need a USB-enabled flashcart that allows for I/O and a dedicated server running in order to be able to play any games that were made compatible.</p>
	<p>With the Nintendo 64 reaching a staggering 30 years of age in June, the console is still making waves in 2026 thanks to the incredible talents of nostalgic modders, hackers, and developers.</p>
