	<h4>Familiar Faces</h4>

	<p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> is still widely regarded as one of the best games of all time, with an average user score of 9.1 and a perfection-tickling 99% metascore on Metacritic, after almost 26 years!</p>
	<p>Fans and modders have always loved tinkering with OOT, creating randomisers and alternate quests, but this brand-spanking new ROM hack for 2026 from modder <a>Aegiker</b> brings across several of the mask transformations directly from the sequel, <i>Majora's Mask</i>.</p>
	<p>Starting the game, you can pause, hit L to toggle the masks, and then equip them to your C buttons. The Fierce Deity mask is only usable in boss rooms, but the three others can be used throughout your entire quest. It should be noted that using the masks is extremely OP and will break a lot of sequences by doing things like entering the water temple early, for example, if you choose to.</p>

	<h4>Masked Marauders</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>It's truly a marvel to see such features ported from the newer game to the older one, as it enhances the possibilities and the ways to play. With the Goron mask you no longer need the megaton hammer, and you can walk across lava and roll through the scenery. As the Deku Scrub, you can skip across water and as the Zora, you can glide through aquatic areas without worrying about drowning.</p>
	<p>If you would like to experience this for yourself, then you will need to patch the USA V1.00 ROM with the supplied BPS file, linked below. The MD5 for <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time V1.0 (U).Z64</i> is 5BD1FE107BF8106B2AB6650ABECD54D6, so please ensure you have dumped or obtained the correct ROM.</p>
	<p>Using <a href="https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/">Marc Robledo's online JS patcher</a>, you can simply upload the ROM and the BPS to obtain the patched ROM. The resulting 32 MB file will have an MD5 of AD35A8AB8B2AF2F42B8F58E27D94BDCC and is playable on real hardware as well as emulators and N64-compatible FPGA machines!</p>
