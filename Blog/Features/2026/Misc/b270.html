	<p>Early last week I heard rumblings via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/qwarq.io/post/3mbposyd46s24">Qwarq.io on BlueSky</a> that a band new build of the ongoing <i>Quest 64</i> recompilation effort had a fresh version in testing that packs in the ability to save your game , thanks to <a href="https://github.com/sonicdcer">SonicDcer's</a> efforts with controller pak support using <a href="https://github.com/sonicdcer/N64ModernRuntime">N64ModernRuntime</a>, as well as incorporating a stable 60 FPS frame rate and higher-resolution visuals.</p>
	<p>Last week I briefly spoke to Rain about it, and last night, the GitHub release link finally appeared. The very first public build, version 0.1, has now been made available for all avid Questers who have their legally obtained <i>Quest 64 (U).Z64</i> ROMs to hand, with an MD5 of EA552E33973468233A0712C251ABDB6B.</p>

	<p>Initial release, very bare-bones. General notes/issues/etc:</p>
	<p>Borrows the launcher from starfox 64, but plays the US version of Quest 64</p>
	<p>Interpolation is not perfect, but mostly fine at 60hz (Brian's hair flickers when running)</p>
	<p>Widescreen is also not perfect but mostly fine</p>
	<p>Pressing F1 allows for changing a bunch of the settings</p>

	<p>Speaking to Rain on Friday, I was informed that this recompilation is built on <a href="https://github.com/Mallos31/Quest">Mallo's Quest 64 decompilation project</a>, which began around 4 years ago, but they were struggling with their build system, so <a href="https://github.com/Rainchus/Quest64-Decomp">Rain stepped in to lend a hand</a>. Over the following years, Rain contributed to the project, but when the Recomp tools by <a href="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy">Mr-Wiseguy</a> were released, Rain wanted to attempt to build a static recompilation PC port with a far simpler game before locking in on <i>Quest 64</i>, which is notably more complicated.</p>
	<p><a href="https://github.com/Rainchus/ChameleonTwist1-JP-Recomp"><i>Chameleon Twist</i></a> was the first game that Rain attempted, borrowing heavily from the <a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp"><i>Majoras Mask</i> Recomp</a> code base, but the project turned out to be less transferable to <i>Quest 64</i>'s decompilation than previously thought, and after 24 hours of labelling and cleaning the Quest 64 codebase, a preliminary working recomp was born but kept relatively low key. Around one year later, saving was added through the latest features of M64ModernRuntime, the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b263"><i>Star Fox 64</i> Recomp port</a> was used as a base, and a slew of fixes and additions applied. The binary was finally shared to the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/0Vr8Ym5bLayc1QCP">Eltale Monsters Discord</a> last week for testers, namely speedrunners, to get to grips with.</p>  
	<p>Up next, it appears that Rain is working with the Japanese, enhanced version of <i>Quest 64</i>, <a href="https://github.com/Rainchus/EltaleMonsters-Decomp"><i>Eltale Monsters'</i></a> code to expand the recompilation project into the best version possible. <i>Eltale Monsters</i> release later than <i>Quest 64</i> and contained a refined balance of combat/grinding/item drops across the game, an extended ending, more stable 50 FPS frame rates, and a higher level of polish throughout.</p>
