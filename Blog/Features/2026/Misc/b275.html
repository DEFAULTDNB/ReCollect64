	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Wiseguy of <a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp">N64: Recompiled</a> fame surprised us all this weekend with an unexpected shadow drop. <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> is the subject of the latest static recompilation project, with the lovable and iconic platformer's <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b27">recently completed</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/banjo.decomp/banjo-kazooie">decompilation project</a> used as a basis, and features such as HD graphics, high FPS, modern controls, widescreen and ultrawide support, as well as mods, including compatibility with <a href="https://evilgames.eu/texture-packs/bk-reloaded.htm">BK: Reloaded</a> available out of the box!</p>

	<p><b>System Requirements</b></p>
	<p>A GPU supporting Direct3D 12.0 (Shader Model 6), Vulkan 1.2, or Metal Argument Buffers Tier 2 support is required to run this project. The oldest GPUs that should be supported for each vendor are:</p>
	<p>GeForce GT 630</p>
	<p>Radeon HD 7750 (the one from 2012, not to be confused with the RX 7000 series) and newer</p>
	<p>Intel HD 510 (Skylake)</p>
	<p>A Mac with Apple Silicon or an Intel 7th Gen CPU with MacOS 13.0+</p>
	<p>On x86-64 PCs, a CPU supporting the SSE4.1 instruction set is also required (Intel Core 2 Penryn series or AMD Bulldozer and newer). ARM64 builds will work on any ARM64 CPU.</p>
	<p>If you have issues with crashes on startup, make sure your graphics drivers are fully up to date.</p>
	<p><b>Features</b></p>
	<p>Plug and Play</p>
	<p>Simply provide your copy of the North American 1.0 version of the game in the main menu and start playing! This project will automatically load assets from the provided copy, so there is no need to go through a separate extraction step or build the game yourself.</p>
	<p>Fully Intact N64 Effects</p>
	<p>All advanced graphical effects, such as the jigsaw puzzle screen transition and Bottles' Moving Picture Game are fully intact and have been adapted for widescreen and high framerates. Fine details such as the game's original mipmapping preserved with a high degree of accuracy.</p>
	<p>Faithful Audio</p>
	<p>Music and sounds are perfectly faithful to the original N64 version of game, with all audio processing intact and no popping or stuttering. Scenes that synchronize audio to visuals have their timings corrected to ensure they remain synchronized as they did on original hardware.</p>
	<p>Easy-to-Use Menus</p>
	<p>Gameplay settings, graphics settings, input mappings, and audio settings can all be configured with the in-game config menu. The menus can all be used with mouse, controller, or keyboard for maximum convenience.</p>
	<p>High Framerate Support</p>
	<p>Play at any framerate you want thanks to functionality provided by RT64! Game objects and terrain, texture scrolling, screen effects, and all HUD elements are all rendered at high framerates. By default, this project is configured to run at your monitor's refresh rate. You can also play at the original framerate of the game if you prefer. Changing framerate has no effect on gameplay.</p>
	<p>Note: External framerate limiters (such as the NVIDIA Control Panel) are known to potentially cause problems, so if you notice any stuttering then turn them off and use the manual framerate slider in the in-game graphics menu instead.</p>
	<p>Widescreen and Ultrawide Support</p>
	<p>Any aspect ratio is supported, with all effects modded to work correctly in widescreen. The HUD can also be positioned at 16:9 when using ultrawide aspect ratios if preferred. Game models have been extended where necessary to ensure cutscenes work correctly in 16:9 aspect ratio. Cutscenes can also be optionally pillarboxed to 16:9 or the game's original aspect ratio to hide any details that weren't meant to be visible.</p>
	<p>Mod Support</p>
	<p>Install community made mods and texture packs! Mods can change any part of the game, including adding completely new features and content. You can install mods by simply dragging the mod files onto the game window before starting the game or by clicking the Install Mods button in the mod menu. Mods can be toggled in the mod menu, and some mods can be configured there as well.</p>
	<p>A Thunderstore mod hosting page is currently being set up for this project. In the meantime, you can find the mods showcased in the release trailer here:</p>
	<p>+ BK Jiggies of Time</p>
	<p>+ BK Nostalgia 64</p>
	<p>+ BK Reloaded Texture Pack</p>
	<p>If you're interested in making mods for this project, check out the mod template and the modding documentation. If you're interested in making texture packs, check out the RT64 documentation. You can also join the N64: Recompiled Modding Discord server.</p>
	<p>Dual Analog Camera</p>
	<p>Play with a dual analog control for finer camera control! When this option is enabled, the right analog stick will control the camera. Buttons mapped to the right analog stick will still work while crouching, so you can keep the C-buttons mapped to it even when this setting is enabled.</p>
	<p>Note Saving</p>
	<p>Keep your notes when leaving a level or dying like in later releases of the game!</p>
	<p>This setting can be turned off to restore the N64 version's note score mechanic. Changing this setting will only take effect when returning to Grunty's Lair or restarting the game.</p>
	<p>Low Input Lag</p>
	<p>This project has been optimized to have as little input lag as possible, making the game feel more responsive than ever!</p>
	<p>Instant Load Times</p>
	<p>Saving and loading files, going from place to place, and pausing all happen in the blink of an eye thanks to the game running natively on modern hardware.</p>
	<p>Linux and Steam Deck Support</p>
	<p>A Linux binary as well as a Flatpak is available for playing on most up-to-date distros, including on the Steam Deck.</p>
	<p>To play on Steam Deck, extract the Linux build onto your deck. Then, in desktop mode, right click the BanjoRecompiled executable file and select "Add to Steam". From there, you can return to Gaming mode and configure the controls as needed.</p>
	<p><b>Planned Features</b></p>
	<p>Ray Tracing via RT64</p>

	<h4>Moddable Madness</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Not only is <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> entirely playable on your PC, but Wiseguy has also included <a href="https://github.com/BanjoRecomp/BKRecompModTemplate">BKModTemplate tools</a> for porting ROM hacks and mods such as the wonderful works of Markus Kurko.</p>
	<p>There are already two additional repositories set up, with <a href="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/Nostalgia64Recomp"><i>BK: Nostalgia</i></a> and <a href="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/JiggiesOfTimeRecomp"><i>BK: The Jiggies of Time</i></a> both already fully recompiled for your pleasure!</p>
	<p>All you need to get started with this recompilation is the V1.00 North American Z64 ROM for <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> with an MD5 of B29599651A13F681C9923D69354BF4A3. Just drop the ROM in, start the executable and begin enjoying. It couldn't be simpler, with no need to extract anything or do anything taxing at all to get it up and running.</p>
	<p>I noticed that <i>Banjo-Tooie</i> is right at the top of <a href="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/banjo-tooie">Wiseguy's repositories</a>, so I wonder how long it will be before we see the sequel statically recompiled too.</p>
