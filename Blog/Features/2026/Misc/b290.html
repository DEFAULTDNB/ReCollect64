	<h4>Retro-Portability</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Rare have today announced that they have partnered with <a href="https://www.hypermegatech.com/">Hyper Mega Tech</a> to produce a limited edition Super Pocket which has not one, but 14 games built in, including the Nintendo 64's <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i>.</p>
	<p>Critically, the N64 game is built into the limited edition console, meaning that you cannot buy it separately yet. Purchasing the console will set you back just £49.99/$59.99/€69.99 but will only include one 64-bit-era game to enjoy on the move.</p>

	<h4>Retooled Rarity</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>This particular edition of Banjo-Kazooie has been optimised to not only work with a D-pad, but also work with the 8-to-32-bit cartridge-based portable. This marks the first actual 64-bit game to come to the Super Pocket, or any other Evercade compatible devices, because usually it's the PSX ports of recognisable N64 titles, such as <i>Glover</i> or <i>40 Winks</i> (which was cancelled before release on the N64), that make the cut.</p>
	<p><i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> is currently playable on Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, Xbox via the 2015 Rare Replay re-releases, and most recently on PC and via <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b275">recompilation</a>. The recompilation, released in January, was the first time that the game was made portable, unofficially, as it came with a Flatpak Linux release which is fully compatible with Steam Deck.</p>
	<p>It would be interesting to see this edition of the platformer dumped and analysed to see what else has changed and what, if any, other N64 games we might be able to get running on the pocketable hardware. Chances are this is a direct port rather than emulation, so I wonder if the decomp has been tapped into at all.</p>
