	<p><i>Banjo Kazooie</i> ROM hacker/modder extraordinaire and friend of the site Markus Kurko has today unveiled a batch of five brand new screenshots for his upcoming and highly anticipated sequel-of-sorts <i>BK4: Quest for Kurkoins</i>, over on his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/150403730">Patreon page</a>.</p>
	<p>Prior to these screenshots there have been <a href="https://x.com/search?q=from%3AMarkus_Kurko%20Kurkoins&src=typed_query&f=top">several other teaser posts</a>, with the last one being made in August 2025, where a video was shown of Spiral Village. The first-ever mention of <i>BK4: Quest for Kurkoins</i> was made in 2021, where the title was tentatively named <i>BK: Kurkoin Quest</i>, and people were asked to submit their ideas for worlds through a series of contests. Since then, the six main worlds and the hub world have been stitched together into one cohesive package, and <i>BK4: Quest for Kurkoins</i> might at last see the light of day!</p>

	<p>Following the incredible <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r84">Bear Witch Project</a> in October 2025 and the unforgettably clever <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r54">Nostalgia 64</a>, there are high hopes for <i>BK4</i> to be something extra special given it's long development time and sequential naming as an extension of the official series.</p>
	<p>Hopefully we should see more information incoming soon, as the developer is known for dropping "coming soon" teases followed by a release around one month later. Let's pray to the bear gods and hope for more of the same!</p>
