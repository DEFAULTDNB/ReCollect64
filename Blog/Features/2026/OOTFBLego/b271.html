	<h4>Bricking it</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Following on from their previous <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b228">teaser</a>, LEGO's latest creation within the <i>Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> crossover has been leaked. This time it's a rather awesome diorama/playset in the shape of 77093 "The Final Battle", featuring Gannon and Link hashing it out across 1003 pieces!</p>
	<p>It should be noted that the information has not been revealed officially, and the official Lego site has not been updated with this information at the time of writing.</p>

	<h4>Building a Series</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The kit is set to retail for $130 or £99.99 and will release on March the 1st, according to Brick Tap, who is widely considered a reliable source for LEGO leaks within the fan community. Containing three mini figures, including Link, Zelda and Ganondorf, as well as a Megaton hammer, recovery hearts, Navi and a whole bunch of action-posable flames and special effects, this set looks fantastic for recreating the iconic end-of-game battle.</p>
	<p>Compared to the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/great-deku-tree-2-in-1-77092">Great Deku Tree</a> kit that arrived in September 2024 for £259.99, the price is staggeringly enticing, and as the second kit in the series, I'm sure fans of <i>Ocarina of Time</i> will want to preorder this as soon as official details land.</p>
	<p>I wonder what other ideas Nintendo and LEGO secretly have up their sleeves? I'm personally hedging my bets for news of something <i>Majoras Mask</i>-related being released at some point in or around 2027. As a massive fan of Skull Kid and the titular mask, I'm on the edge of my seat and looking forward to the day that, hopefully, happens!</p>
	<p>What's more likely is some kind of tie-in to the upcoming <i>Legend of Zelda</i> movie (set to release in 2027), which would make more sense but it would break my heart if no <i>Majora's Mask</i> sets ever come to exist.</p>
