	<h4>Musical Magic</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Who doesn't adore classic video game music? Nintendo has been decimating our eardums with their melodic mixes for decades, and they have a vast range of styles and themes at their disposal. The Nintendo Music App, which was released on October 30th, 2024, aims to deliver full game soundtracks directly into your listening orifices via a dedicated app, as only Nintendo could!</p>

	<p>So the key points are that you'll need an NSO subscription, and you have to download the Nintendo Music app for your platform. Why not use Spotify or another existing storefront? Nintendo probably wants full control of their audible properties and therefore 100% of the profit.</p>
	<p>Immediately following this announcement, I turned my attention to finding out exactly what N64 flavored beats would be appearing on the service, only to be met with this incredibly teeny-tiny list:</p>
		<div class="container">
		<ul>
			<li>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time ~ 82 tracks
			<li>Star Fox 64 (Lylat Wars) ~ 39 tracks
		</ul>
		</div>
	<p>We technically get a few more N64 themed tracks by way of the <i>Mario Kart 8</i> soundtrack and renditions of </i>Super Mario 64</i> via the <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i> playlists, but I had hoped for a little more.</p>
	<p>Nintendo have stated that they are going to be adding to this selection periodically, and they have already added <i>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</i> and stated that another sound track will be added next week! I certainly hope they won't be utilizing the same incredibly sporadic drip-feeding mechanic they use to distribute games across their NSO service, because I don't want to have to wait a ridiculously long time to listen to more great N64-centric content that I know they have stored in the vault.</p>
	<p>Perhaps I'm showing my age here, but where are the obvious classics? I fully expected to see something more akin to the original release games, per-generation, represented in chronological order, or at very least in a more obvious selection.</p>
	<p>Here are some of the Nintendo 64 games OSTs I had hoped I would be able to listen to, in all their glory, day one:</p>
	<div class="container">
		<ul>
			<li>1080° Snowboarding
			<li>Mario Kart 64
			<li>Pilotwings 64
			<li>Super Mario 64 (Added: 24/12/2024)
			<li>The Legend of Zelda Majoras Mask
			<li>Wave Race 64 (Added: 10/12/2024)
			<li>Yoshi's Story
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p>Not having the <i>Super Mario 64</i> OST on this service day one I find rather odd; even not representing Pilotwings 64 is disappointing but forgivable, but not having Wave Race 64 is a huge omission here! It's one of the most vibrant games out there from Nintendo's day one 1996 line-up, so much so that there is even a fan account out there on X/Twitter (<a href="https://x.com/WaveRace64" target="_blank">@WaveRace64Official</a>) dedicated to the otherwise forgotten about aquatic IP!</p>
	<p>Honorable mention must go to Nintendo adding the Wii's system menu music to the service; that's a ballsy move, and I respect it!</p>
	<h4>Sound Advice</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Nintendo knows what they're doing when it comes to printing money, but I really don't believe they know what they're doing when it comes to true preservation.</p>
	<p>For starters, they have been forcefully removing content from YouTube, and other major services to make way for their official (read: paid) Nintendo Music app. They have also been caught using emulation in their shiny new Nintendo Museum, regardless of their stance on emulaton and their inability to get it right for N64 at very least (releasing poorly QA'd effigies of their classic games on the NSO service). There are still glaring problems regarding texture/sound issues in N64 games that released well over a year ago!</p>
	<p>Let's be real, Nintendo will probably add games like the list mentioned above eventually, but will we end up seeing any classic N64 OST's from third-parties? Perhaps something to align with the games on NSO currently? Will we get the wonderfully opulent orchestral editions of games like the <i>Zelda</i> series or the <i>Mario</i> franchise?</p>
	<p>This is Nintendo we are talking about; I should have learned to reign in my expectations by now.</p>
		<div class="info">
			<p><strong>UPDATE 1:</strong> 19/11/2024 - F-Zero X OST has been added to the service, with 20 tracks! Sadly there are no 64DD F-Zero X Expansion Kit songs.</p>
			<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> 10/12/2024 - Wave Race 64 OST has now been added, with 32 tracks!</p>
			<p><strong>UPDATE 3:</strong> 24/12/2024 - Super Mario 64 OST has now been added, with 36 tracks. Notably, Piranha Plant's Lullaby (Piano Version) is also included!</p>
			<p><strong>UPDATE 4:</strong> 31/03/2025 - F-Zero X Expansion Kit (64DD) OST has arrived, with possibly the best version of Rainbow Road to ever be produced!</p>
			<p><strong>UPDATE 5:</strong> 24/06/2025 - Yoshi's Story OST has now been added with 49 tracks!</p>
