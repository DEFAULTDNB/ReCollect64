	<h4>Masters of the Harbour</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As an update to the initial <a href="Blog/Features/StarFoxPCPort/b51.html" target="_blank">Star Fox 64 PC port news reported on November 25th, 2024</a>, the Star Fox 64 PC port, now known as Starship Centauri Alfa, is available to play on Windows PC thanks to the Harbour Masters (Sonicdcer and KiritoDv), of <i>Zelda OOT & MM</i> PC Porting fame.</p>
	<p>The playable executable comes mere months after the <i>Star Fox 64</i> decompilation project succeeded in producing 1:1 matching source code to the beloved classic action-packed flight sim.</p>
	<p>In short, the port requires you to have the starfox64.us.rev1.z64 ROM with an MD5 of 741A94EEE093C4C8684E66B89F8685E8 to play. You then need to run "generate_otr.bat" to extract and populate the "Assets" folder, and finally you can run "Starship.exe" to launch your game.</p>

	<h4>Moddable Mayhem</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Once custom mods and updated HD or reworked textures appear, you will simply be able to place .o2r and .otr files in a folder named "mods" and then select them from the menu once the game is running by pressing F1 or hitting Tab to toggle alternative assets.</p>
	<p>This first release has been curated to fix as many bugs as possible before its initial release and features wide and ultrawide screen modes, modern controller support, and adjustable FPS to suit your preferences!</p>
	<p>Hopefully multiplayer and cooperative modes will join the fun via updates soon, as this first release primarily focuses on single player aspects and bug fixes so far.</p>
	<p>With just two days to go until Christmas 2024, this is a much-welcomed early xmas present for PC users, though Mac and Linux players will still need to wait a little while longer to play natively on their systems.</p>
