	<h4>Refreshed Hardware</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Analogue has finally announced their long awaited reimagining of the N64 by way of the Analogue 3D!</p>
	<p>Almost one year ago, to the day, the FPGA system was announced with scant details, today they have finally lifted the shroud and given us an idea of the hardware to come, the release date, and the expected feature set!</p>
	<div class="container">
	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>Introducing Analogue 3D. A reimagining of the N64.</p>
	<p>In 4K resolution. Perhaps the greatest multiplayer system of all time. Analogue 3D is the worlds first 100% compatible with every original N64 game ever made. Region Free. Bluetooth LE. Dual-band Wifi. Four original-style controller ports. Entirely new, next generation Analogue hardware featuring 3D OS. Engineered entirely in FPGA. No Emulation.</p>
	<p>The games aren’t the past—they’re now. Analogue 3D gives you the N64 you need, brought back pure and ready.</p>

	<h4>The Future of N64</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i>
	Analogue 3D represents a milestone in video game preservation. It’s not just a reimagining of the N64—it’s the first fully compatible, hardware-accurate recreation, fully compatible with the entire N64 game library. After nearly four years of dedicated FPGA engineering, Analogue 3D overcomes the limitations of software emulation—no input lag, no graphic or audio inaccuracies, no timing or frame rate problems. 
	This is the N64, perfected and true to its core.
	<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
	<p>Also announced was the $39.99 8BitDo 64 controller, which is the wireless controller built for the system and features the classic buttons in a more modern package. I personally will be hoping to use the NSO N64 controller, along with the Blue Retro adaptor, in order to replay my games!</p>
	<p>With preorders starting next week and a price of just $249.99, the system is a lot more affordable than I initially thought it might be!</p>
	<p>I will be jumping on this day one if possible. I have been waiting for something like this to come along for a very long time, and with the state of the Polymega's ordering system and pricing, it's simply never been worth the aggravation trying to get one just to play N64 games on.</p>
