	<h4>Retro Rebirth</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Rockergaming, the controller aficionado, specialising in designing high-quality parts and mods, recently shared that his much-anticipated stick replacement project is coming to a crescendo, and people will be able to purchase them very soon.</p>
	<p>The stick design itself has been through dozens of updates that incorporates feedback from speedrunners and testers alike. As a result, all parts have been continually tweaked to squeeze out as much precision, performance, and comfort as possible. The gears alone had been prototyped for over a year, and the project, now in its second year, shows multiple areas of refinement, including the mirror-finished, specially hardened Renaissance Steel bowls, modular swappable parts, and removable/swappable, grippy thumb-caps on the top of the stick itself.</p>
	<p>Lastly, the lower housing and gate (the octagonal plastic that retains the sticks range) have also been re-engineered to be as close to the OEM parts as humanly possible but cast from injection moulded polycarbonate (bulletproof glass) for extreme durability with no give. It's an incredibly arduous task, but RockerGame took time away from streaming and content production to tackle this issue, and he has come out the other side swinging!</p>

	<p>Its been almost 2 years of working on a reimagination of the N64 stick module I've dubbed "Project Renaissance" and we are getting very close to bearing the fruits of that labor.</p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
	</div>
	<p>The project currently has high-quality injection moulds being tuned that are ready to produce the next generation of analogue sticks, and they're being sculpted to a precision of within 1/3rd the width of a human hair!</p>

	<p>The analogue stick's benchmarks have been compiled using <a href="https://github.com/wermipls/mimi" target="_blank">Wermipls' Mimi benchmark ROM</a>, and as you can see from the prototype testing results below; the range fluctuation is so minuscule that the consistency of notch values across three tests is within 0.12 standard deviation.</p>

	<h4>Masters of the Craft</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With the project set for release early in 2025, RockerGaming reiterated that early access had been granted to speedrunners and enthusiasts so that they can continue to be stringently tested by the best people out there that could possibly identify in any inconsistencies, such as gate degradation leading to drifting, etc.</p>
	<p>RockerGaming's other recent projects, including the steel bowl, which forms one of the core components of Project Renaissance, have been widely popular with the advanced sales of the steel bowls used to fund further steps in the larger assignment and completely selling out to much fanfare with incredibly high product reviews from the people that purchased them.</p>
	<p>It's interesting to see a purely engineering-driven version of the OEM sticks being created, in juxtaposition to the latest Hall Effect offerings, because Project Renaissance certainly reinvents and refines the original stick technology in such a user-focused way that it's impossible to express anything other than complete glee when you see an update about its progress!</p>
	<p>Rest assured that I will be covering its release when it happens!</p>
