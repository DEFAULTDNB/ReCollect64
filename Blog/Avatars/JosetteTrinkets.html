	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat JosetteTrinkets! As my regular ReCollect64 readers *should* know by now, we have worked on a couple of N64 projects together now, such as the <a href="blog.html#b7">Operation Cards</a> deep dive, the ongoing addition of strategy guides to the ReCollect64 Collectors site, and, throughout this, you have also helped me enormously by sourcing high quality pictures and scans for ReCollect64's image repository for lesser known items and oddities.<p>In your own words, how you would describe your N64 mission on social media?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JosetteTrinkets.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I don't have a "mission" in particular. I really just enjoy the history side of retro gaming. Particularly Japanese N64 history. I started with a friend attempting to catalog every N64 strategy guide across all regions. It's sort if ballooned from there and spearheaded my collection and enthusiasm for n64 history.</p></div>

	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JosetteTrinkets.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I've been gaming for as long as I can remember. Born in 92' I can remember my grandmother playing Super Mario World with me(and still have photos of it). My father played a lot of PC games back then and the first PC game I played was Age of Empire. I remember sitting on his lap creating villagers and building up our towns.</p></div>

	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JosetteTrinkets.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I collect mostly Nintendo 64 but I also have quite a few modern switch games. I really like the Shantae series and own the entire CE of them. I also own many games from Nes-Switch, PS-PS4(minus ps3), xbox - xbox 360, atari, sega, etc.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JosetteTrinkets.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Nintendo 64, bar none. It was the first console that was 100% "mine".</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JosetteTrinkets.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I regularly play Ocarina of time and Banjo kazooie at least once a year. I also find myself popping in SNES games at random.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JosetteTrinkets.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Gotta have Oreo's Double Stuffed. I can eat through a package in a couple of days!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JosetteTrinkets.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>This is such an incredibly difficult question. I have quite a few items that are super cool. I always try to get items that would make anybody say, "they made that?". A couple that stand out are an MRC: Multi Racing Championship branded box of napkins and a Miniature N64 Digital Clock. Both from Japan.</p></div>				
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JosetteTrinkets.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Hmm, there are a number of "unicorn" items I am searching for. The one that stands out the most to me would be the soundtrack for Wonder Project J2 for a decent price.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games in particular, regarding the recent N64 Recomp projects?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JosetteTrinkets.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I am looking forward to EVERY gane that gets a Recomp port!</p></div>

	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JosetteTrinkets.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Pepperoni, Cheese, and Sausage. The classic.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JosetteTrinkets.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My max spend varies depending on the item. I always try to hold out for cheaper items if possible, but I know when something is worth it's high price tag. I think my most expensive item is my CE of the Switch version of Shantae and the Pirate's Curse for Nintendo Switch. Just realized I didnt really answer 10. I think it was around $500 for that, I didn't know that I would go that high again and that took quite the convincing to my wife 🤣</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>And Finally: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JosetteTrinkets.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I have 14 consoles in total!</p></div>
