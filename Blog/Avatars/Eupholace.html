	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Eupholace! Let's kick-off this Q&A by describing your presence on social media for people:</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Eupholace.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Hey! I’m William AKA Eupholace, and I mainly enjoy posting about my gamedev projects and whatever other random hobbies I’m into at the moment. I also work for Moon Studios as a level designer, so social media is a nice opportunity for me to show my work there as well!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Eupholace.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My earliest gaming memories are probably from when I was about 4 or 5 - I have a lot of older siblings, so I usually just played whatever they owned. That meant I had a bit more retro game exposure than someone my age might normally have. The games I remember most from that time would be Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Mario Sunshine.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Eupholace.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Unfortunately, I sold what few retro games I owned when the Nintendo Switch was announced so I could save up for it. I was barely too young to have a job back then, so I needed to scrounge up cash wherever I could - the console just looked too exciting to miss! I do remember that I used to personally own Super Mario Land 2 and F-Zero X, but again, most of the retro games I played were ones my siblings owned.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Eupholace.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Probably my Switch, it was the first big console I personally owned and it has many of my favorite games. The Wii was also particularly special to me.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Eupholace.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>It’s a bit embarrassing, but I’m a bit of an avid Fortnite player, haha. That’s sort of my comfort game to play with friends. For more traditional games, I typically enjoy going back to Terraria, Spelunky 2, and Mario Odyssey. I’m not usually one to replay games though, if I do I prefer to replay when it’s been long enough that I’ve forgotten much about it.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Eupholace.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Nothing! I don’t really like snacking while gaming, and I’m mostly just a water drinker. Being both a professional and hobbyist gamedev means I’m sometimes sitting for upwards of 10-12 hours a day, so I’ve started trying to prioritize my health more. I do enjoy my daily cup of coffee in the morning though!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Eupholace.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I wouldn’t say so, I’m not exactly a collector - but the most valuable one I have at least is probably my physical copy of Super Mario 3D All-Stars, I’m sure that thing sells for a few hundred bucks on eBay these days.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Eupholace.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>There’s nothing I’m really looking for, but I feel like as a gamedev, I’d really love to have some original physical game design document or something. Although, I imagine those aren’t exactly lying around on sale in many places!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games in particular, regarding the recent N64 Recomp projects?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Eupholace.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Not exactly, I’m not a modder. I would have said Banjo-Kazooie if any, but that’s been done! So next would be Banjo-Tooie I suppose.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Eupholace.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Hmm, that’s tough. Usually sausage is enough, but if I had to pick two more, maybe mushrooms and pepperoni.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Eupholace.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Don’t think I’ve made any notable ones! Although I’d probably like to eventually, I’ve been to a few retro games stores recently and I think that ignited the desire to get something.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>And Finally: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Eupholace.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>SNES Classic, Ps4 Pro, Ps5 (disc version), Nintendo Switch (4)</p></div>

	<p>Thank you very much for your time and being part of ReCollect64 chats!</p></div>

	<p>Eupholace's entry within a game developing environment such as Moon Studios is an incredibly aspirational story of how crafting in a game can lead to professional job offers!</p> 
	<p>Most recently, he has been working with <a href="https://x.com/Piece_of_Craft" target="_blank">Piece of Craft</a> on creating some stunning <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b52" target="_blank">Banjo-Kazooie themed creations in Dreams for Playstation 4</a>. You'd better believe that I am intently keeping tabs on this project because it's wonderfully nostalgic!</p>
	<p>If you would like to check out some of Eupholaces incredible work, then please give them a follow on their various platforms!</p>
