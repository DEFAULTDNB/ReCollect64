	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Wave Race 64! Let's begin this Q&A by describing a little about yourself and what you do.</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/WR64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>BANZAIIIIIIIiiiiiii! I'm Wave Race 64, a factpost/shitpost account dedicated to the undisputed best, most chill-vibed, aquatic racer of all time!💦</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/WR64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I remember playing Wave Race on the Game Boy and Micro Machines and Super Mario Kart on the SNES in the early 90s and thinking these were fantastic racers. By the mid-90s the "Ultra 64" was coming soon, and all I could think of was playing Wave Race 64 and Cruisin' USA.💦</p>
	<p>After seeing the arcade version versus the release version, I totally swerved Cruis'n USA, but I snapped up Wave Race 64 in a heartbeat, and the atmosphere, wave physics and the soundtrack all resonated with me to my very core.💦</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/WR64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I don't own a lot of games, but I do have several copies of Wave Race 64 from around the world (probably 15 or so) and a **MAXIMUM POWER** Ice Blue Hori controller that fills my heart with glee every time I pick it up and play with it.💦</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/WR64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>The Atar.... nah, it's the Nintendo 64 for sure. Nothing else has ever come close to this lightning-in-a-bottle console.💦</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/WR64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I mostly jet around Dolphin Park, pulling sweet stunts and ramming into dolphins, but sometimes I also play Wave Race 64 a lot more than is probably healthy. Contrary to popular belief, I do still play Blue Storm as well, but I f*cking hate that piece of f*cking shit, and I only play it to gloat at how f*cking bad it is in comparison.💦</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/WR64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Umbongo, a Yorkie, and Hubba Bubba. They keep me fully off my tits on sugar and ready to triple backflip off anything.💦</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/WR64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>It's not exactly one thing, but I got some Wave Race 64 stickers from JoyPadLad's store a year or so ago. Those things bring me legitimate joy to look at every single time I find one I've randomly placed around my office.💦</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/WR64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I had a dream recently that Shigeru Miyamoto was creeping around my bedroom, scurrying from corner to corner, muttering incoherent Japanese words. Turns out he had gifted me something quite nice under my pillow. It was the only known Nintendo prototype cartridge of Wave Race 64. You know the one; it has the F-Zero-like transforming vehicles, and was demonstrated before the push to use Jet Ski's was made. That's what I really want to play before I shuffle off this mortal coil.💦</p>
	<p>Oh, and for anyone wondering, yes, I did fear that Uncle Shiggy was about to slap me with a furious cease and desist, and yes, I found that I had thoroughly pissed the bed when I awoke.💦</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games in particular, regarding the recent N64 Recomp projects?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/WR64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I've seen some footage of Wave Race 64 circulating with (slightly) fancier wave effects; I believe the person said it was a test that was <a href="https://x.com/dariosamo/status/1561864300511121408?s=20">ray traced with RT64</a>, whatever that is. I don't think it's out yet, I haven't seen you post about it on ReCollect64 yet (!), but I would love to play that. Any sort of refreshed version of Wave Race 64 would be great to see, with slicker frame rates and enhanced effects. Imagine a four-player hack with that!💦</p></div>

	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what's your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/WR64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Killer whale sausage, dolphin bacon and a slightly frothed sweet barbecue seaweed sauce. Follow me for more tasty aquatic recipes! (Soon™)💦™</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/WR64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I don't like spending money, so any additional copies of Wave Race 64 that cost me less than £5 make me feel like I'm rich beyond my wildest dreams. One day I want to swim around in a vault full of them, like Scrooge McDuck.💦</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Lastly: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/WR64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Just a PS5, a Nintendo Switch and a Nintendo 64 I've had since it was released. It's everything I need to enjoy most games these days, but I would like a PC or something to play these recompiled games and whatnot.💦</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
