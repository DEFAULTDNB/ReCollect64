	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat! Let's kick-off this Q&A by describing your presence on social media for people:</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Oakieland.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I go by "Facts About BK" or "Oakieland" on most social medias. On Facts About BK I usually distribute niche facts about the Banjo-Kazooie series and include discoveries and findings. Our recent biggest discovery was finding the Banjo-X model of Banjo in a prototype of Viva Pinata. OlieGamerTV had found it after fixing a developer tool and I was able to rip it then distribute on SketchFab.</p></div>

	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Oakieland.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I always played games. The first video games I owned was Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3 and Godzilla: Domination! for the GameBoy Advance. I starting playing on my dad's Nintendo 64 when I was a toddler. I almost exclusively played Banjo-Tooie and Turok 2: Seeds of Evil because of the dinosaurs.</p></div>

	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Oakieland.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My retro game collection is mostly just Banjo-Kazooie merchandise and the series in a few languages.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Oakieland.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Nintendo Switch. It has all the games I loved on GameCube minus one or two. It has Spyro, Mario + Rabbids, Bugsnax, Bug Fables, and Super Mario Odyssey is still one of the best 3D platformers I've ever played.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Oakieland.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Recently? R.E.P.O.</p>
	<p>Overtime? Dungeons & Dragons. I've been a forever Dungeon Master since 2021. I have a game every week. At most I've hosted 3 games at a time with separate groups (on/off Fridays and Saturdays). My longest session to date was 14 hours long. Though I've shrunk it down to 2 games, one group every Friday and one group every other Saturday, each only 4-5 hours. Current campaign for both is Rime of the Frostmaiden.</p></div>

	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Oakieland.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Crunchy Flamin' Hot Limón Cheetos and a Sugar-Free Monster.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Oakieland.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>A metal pre-order keychain of Banjo that was exclusive to the UK and Canadian markets when Banjo-Kazooie 1st released on the Nintendo 64.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Oakieland.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>PTOPOnline's Banjo-X prototype that they reported on. The data and information even if its an unbootable prototype is enticing to me.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games in particular, regarding the recent N64 Recomp projects?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Oakieland.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Banjo-Tooie. I wish to see modding efforts go towards that.</p></div>

	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Oakieland.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>A local pizza place closed down but they had a really good pizza. It was Bacon, Parmesan Garlic Fries topped with a in-house fry sauce. It has been four years and I still think about it every once in a while.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Oakieland.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>The Japanese-exclusive Tooty plush made by Takara. It was $400 USD on eBay and now sits in a Banjo-Tooie coffee cup on a shelf. </p></div>

	<p>Lastly: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>

	<p>Some fantastic answers! Thank you so much for your time and for being part of ReCollect64's Q&A chats!</p></div>

	<p>As well as currently working on <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b142">BKGR: Reimagined</a>, a wonderful project that aims to bring the 2D GBA title into 3D for PC, Oakieland also runs Facts_About_BK, which posts interesting and unique Banjo-Kazooie-related facts and trivia, along with the latest updates from the BKGR: Reimagined project.</p>
	<p>If you're into <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> in any way, shape or form, then I highly recommend checking out Oakieland's socials and project pages; there is some cracking content to be found!</p>
