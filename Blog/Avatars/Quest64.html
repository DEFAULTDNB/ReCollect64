		<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Quest64, or should I call you Brian/Mike?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>Mike is fine, over the last few months we've become pretty friendly and it's nice to use a name 🙂</p></div>
		<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
		<p>Shall we kick-off this Q&A by describing your Questing antics on social media?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>I don't think I really have a thing anymore to be honest. The overall goal is to make Quest 64 more visible on the internet in a memorable way, but the road to getting there is weird. 
		There are days where I focus on jarring people's memories about the Nintendo 64 and the games outside of the normal Goldeneye/Smash Bros/etc...posts you see all the time. 
		Other days it's talking about the retro gaming discourse and what we can do to improve it for everyone. A lot of times it's just Quest 64 memes and me chasing people around social media with pictures of Brian. 
		I like to keep it fresh.</p></div>
		<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
		<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>The first system our family owned was an NES, my parents got it for my brother and I when I was 4/5 (early 89). It was an absolute blast and my Mom was super into it as well, 
		so a lot of my gaming memories and favorite games were ones I shared with her. She is the reason I have such a fondness for Bomberman, as Mega Bomberman on the Sega Genesis was a longtime favorite of hers.</p></div>
		<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
		<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>I have a lot of physical games, though I have been trying to shave my collection down as I get older. There was a point where I probably had between 4000/5000 physical games across all the systems.....
		but as time has passed I've sold/traded some of them to continue building my Nintendo 64 collection (and make more space in my house)</p></div>
		<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
		<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>Absolutely! It's the Nintendo 64! Another system my parents bought for me, and one we shared a bunch of memories with....something I'm trying to keep doing with my kids.</p></div>
		<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
		<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>I don't have a routine for games, though obviously I play Quest 64 quite a bit lol. Most of my game time these days is games my kids want to play, so it's been a lot of ARMS, Animal Crossing, Roblox, Kirby Forgotten Land...and almost always on the Switch. 
		I still play a fair amount of Nintendo 64, but mostly games I didn't grow up with so I can familiarize myself with the entire library more.</p></div>
		<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
		<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled for gaming?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>My favorite go to snacks are all banana based. I like peanut butter and banana sandwiches, banana pancakes/bread and smoothies....but for traditional garbage food I'm fond of regular Lay's potato chips and Dr. Pepper. Really anything will do though, I'm a food hole.</p></div>
		<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
		<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>I don't really thing there's one thing I hold above everything else. I have a fondness for Densha De Go pocket watches, so that's probably the most unique thing in my collection.</p></div>
		<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
		<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>This one is a moving target for me. There's not one thing I dream about, but when I find out that there's an article I want to read in a hard to find copy of Gamefan magazine or a official N64 soundtrack I've never seen before and isn't online.....
		I tend to get hyper-fixated.</p></div>
		<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
		<p>Are you looking forward to Quest64 via N64Recomp?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>YES! The amazing people over at the <a href="https://discord.gg/0Vr8Ym5bLayc1QCP" target="_blank">Quest 64 Speedrun Discord</a> were already working on a traditional decomp of the game, but the new Wiseguy tools are exciting and I hope to see Quest 64 make it's way to PC through a recomp sooner than later!</p></div>

		<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>I'm traditionally a cheese pizza guy, but if forced to pick three more toppings I would probably do onions, sausage and red chili flakes.</p></div>
		<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
		<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>The most expensive game I every purchased was Super Bowling...I think I paid $250USD for it, but that money came from selling a bunch of Guitar Hero guitars during the pandemic to make space in my basement, so it was close to a wash. 
		The most thrifty thing came recently, I spent $1 at a thrift store on a Code Lyoko OST CD that regularly sells for north of $100. Hopefully I'll be trading that soon though as there are lots of people looking for it and that's not really my thing.</p></div>
		<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
		<p>Finally: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>I have around 45 consoles but as for games, I have no idea anymore lol. I do have just over 500 N64 games, and the total games across all systems is probably north of 3500-4000. I really should go through and re-catalogue everything but that seems like such a job....especially when I really don't play a lot of them anymore.</p></div>
