	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Flashback64! Let's kick-off this Q&A by describing your presence on social media for people:</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Flashback64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Hello! Our names are Gooey and McKenna and we host the podcast Flashback 64. On our show we cover the library of the Nintendo 64 in chronological order as well as discuss other bits of culture from the time period. We are a married couple and it is a fun project for us to both relive some of the past and learn about a lot of games we have not played.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Flashback64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>The first game Gooey fell in love with at a young age was the original Super Mario Brothers on the NES. As long as I’ve had memories I have been playing that game. McKenna started with Pokemon Yellow and is still a massive Pokemon fan to this day.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Flashback64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>We are not massive collectors, but as we move through the games on our podcast I like to pick up the original cartridges so that we can play the games on their original hardware. It’s a fun way to expand my collection while preventing myself from going overboard.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Flashback64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>The N64 of course ;) But we seriously are pretty big Nintendo heads. McKenna loves the Switch for its portability and large collection of indie games. We are also massive Zelda fans and some of McKenna's favorite releases have been on the Switch. For Gooey I would probably say the GameCube. It not only had a bunch of great first party Nintendo releases but its where they first experienced Resident Evil 4!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Flashback64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>We of course always have some Nintendo 64 game going on at some time. McKenna is really into indie games, in particular life sim style games. She has a YouTube channel, Harvest Gamer Mckliz where you can find her playing a lot of them. We both enjoy Zelda quite a bit as well. Gooey has been slowly working their way through the Zelda series and ranking all of the dungeons on their Gooey Fame YouTube channel as well.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you both fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Flashback64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>McKenna - Coffee and Chocolate</p>
	<p>Gooey - Chips and Soda (a little cliche)</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Flashback64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Honestly it's probably the Nintendo 64. The console and a handful of the games previously belonged to now passed family and friends and playing it always reminds me of them.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Flashback64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I’m not quite sure yet. I know there are some rare N64 carts, but I haven’t had to encounter that yet. Ask me again sometime!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games in particular, regarding the recent N64 Recomp projects?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Flashback64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>The Recomp stuff seems really cool and wild but I have not personally dug into it that much at least yet. It looks really sweet though!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what are your combos?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Flashback64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>McKenna - Sausage, Pepperoni, and Mushrooms</p>
	<p>Gooey - Mushrooms, Onion, and Broccoli</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Flashback64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>So far the only expensive item I’ve had to obtain was Mischief Makers. It wasn’t too bad though. Not sure if I’m gonna pick up stuff like ClayFighter Sculptor's Cut…</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>And Finally: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Flashback64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Not counting duplicates - 12</p></div>
