	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 Q&A chats Space Station Silicon Valley! Please tell us a bit about yourself.</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SpacestationSV.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>On this most recent account I was inspired by the Nintendo Dads. Their community was so wholesome and friendly, and I wanted to do the same thing for the retro gaming community, since that was my primary focus. Gaming circles can be very toxic, especially towards women, youth, and minorities. So I wanted to create a space where everyone can celebrate the games they like without fear of bullying.</p></div>

	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SpacestationSV.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My older brother had an NES when I was really young. But I'd say what cemented MY place as a gamer was getting the Donkey Kong Country SNES bundle for Christmas in '94. I was 9 and that game forever changed my life. It's still my favorite game of all time</p></div>

	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SpacestationSV.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Mostly Nintendo starting with the SNES onward, but I have my love for OG Xbox and PS3 as well. I also like to collect strategy guides and vintage mags when I can find them cheap. Also I love action figures, but I usually don't spend much on them because they're mostly display items</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SpacestationSV.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My favorite console of all time has to be the GameCube. I got it at a time in my life when I had a bunch of disposable income, and no responsibilities. So my high school years were FULL of gaming with friends on that little purple box. Melee, Double Dash, Animal Crossing, Gotcha Force, DK Jungle Beat, etc...</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SpacestationSV.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>These days I play whatever is current on the Switch. But I always like to go back and play some of my old favorites. I recently picked up Chibi Robo for GameCube and I plan on playing through it soon.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SpacestationSV.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Gotcha Force. And not just because it's expensive. It's one of my favorite games of all time and it was a gift to me from my community for my birthday a few years ago. It's a symbol of the strength in our community to me. Plus it's just fun as heck!</p></div>

	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SpacestationSV.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I have a short list of expensive games I'm saving up for. StarCraft 64, Skies Of Arcadia Legends to name a few!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games via N64 Recomp?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SpacestationSV.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I honestly don't do much with emulation. And when I do I try to keep the experience as authentic as possible. That's not to say I have a problem with roms or emulation. More power to you. Collecting these days is EXPENSIVE and I encourage anyone to play old games however they want! But for me it's all about authenticity since I grew up with these games.</p></div>

	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SpacestationSV.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>First of all, replace the tomato sauce with pesto. Then we'll do mozzarella and prosciutto. That's gormet pizza right there.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>How many games consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SpacestationSV.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>18 consoles (home and handheld), Almost 400 games, and 114 pieces of print media. ♥️</p></div>

	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SpacestationSV.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>As I said Gotcha Force is my most expensive item, but that was a gift. The most I've ever spent personally on a game is my recent Chibi Robo pick-up for $200. There's a story behind it though. I've been wanting a copy since I started recollecting a few years ago. But last year I lost my job and all my "fun money" was put on hold so we could pay bill. I told myself once I got a job I'd buy Chibi Robo with my first paycheck. And on May 1st of this year I got a job. It was such a triumphant purchase!</p></div>

	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SpacestationSV.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Chocolate covered pretzels, root beer, Cape Cod Potato Chips, and whatever Liquid Death flavor my local corner store has in stock</p></div>
