	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 Q&A chats OgreBattleUnit! Please tell us a bit about yourself.</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/OgreBattle64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I began this account as a way to connect with other fans of the Ogre Battle 64 title and the rest of the franchise. I quickly discovered I was not alone in my nostalgia for such a unique game with a compelling story. This has become a great way to meet and share personal anecdotes on gaming and nostalgia in general.</p></div>

	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/OgreBattle64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My family had very little while I was growing up. We had a hand me down Nintendo Entertainment System from a distant family member with just Super Mario Bros and Duck Hunt wih no Zapper light gun. In 1992 my parents got us a SNES with a copy of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Six year old me was absolutely hooked on gaming after finally defeating the first boss.</p></div>

	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/OgreBattle64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My physical collection is very nostalgic and reminiscent of where I was in life at any given time. I've only ever collected what was important to me or if it had an impact on me and then I would go all in on it. I have a penchant for keeping games and systems I purchase so now I still have most if not everything I've ever owned. As far as hobbies go it has been very fulfilling.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/OgreBattle64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>If I was forced to decide a favorite it would be a tough decision between the SNES and Playstation 1. Those systems really lit a fire in me for JRPGs and RPGs alike. Lots of late nights trying to defeat a particular boss, find an item, or discover a hidden character. As well as many trips to the local library to look up game guides on their internet connected computers to print out for 10 cents a sheet.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/OgreBattle64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I always seem to have some campaign or run through of Ogre Battle 64 going at any given time. As a parent and spouse I find myself gravitating towards games I can pause or drop in and out of. I have been playing a lot of Helldivers 2, Manor Lords, and I am currenly working on my second playthrough of Unicorn Overlord.</p></div>

	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/OgreBattle64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I still have the overworld map that came with my copy of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. It has been tacked up on every wall of every room I've ever lived in, the poor thing has been torn and taped up so many times over the years. It now resides on my office wall.</p></div>

	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/OgreBattle64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I've been on the prowl for a Prima's Official Strategy Guide for Ogre Battle 64 for the last 10 years or so. After waiting for it to happen in the wild I gave up and I finally snagged one online. I guess it is time to find a new unicorn to hunt!</p></div>

	<p>Are you looking forward to any games via N64 Recomp?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/OgreBattle64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>The obvious answer is Ogre Battle 64, of course. I also would really like to see Winback: Covert Operations and Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire get the treatment.</p></div>

	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/OgreBattle64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Pepperoni, mushrooms, and bell peppers. All day.</p></div>

	<p>How many games consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/OgreBattle64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>If we are counting all the Gameboy variants I am currently sitting at 19 owned consoles. My console collecting has slowed since moving to PC gaming.</p></div>

	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/OgreBattle64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I haven't met my hard limit yet for something that I really want. I've seen a lot of things in the retro market get out of hand but my current most valuable item is probably my copy of the Prima's Strategy Guide for Ogre Battle 64 at the moment.</p></div>

	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/OgreBattle64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I'm a big fan of cashews. There is always a jar of them on my desk that I'm reaching for.</p></div>
