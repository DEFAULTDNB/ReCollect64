	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Gerry! Let's kick-off this Q&A by describing your presence on social media for people:</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BehindTheCode.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My name is Gerry, and I run a small YouTube channel called <a href="https://youtube.com/@behindthecode_wgerry">“Behind The Code With Gerry”</a>.</p>
	<p>I primarily post videos on various retro video game development kits. Full functional demonstrations of both the hardware and software. (Circa 1990 to early 2000s.)</p>
	<p>I’m a Digital-Electronics and Robotics Technician by trade, so I also post videos on various electronics and robotics projects I have on the go. My website is <a href="https://www.behindthecode.ca">https://www.behindthecode.ca</a></p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BehindTheCode.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>The first game I ever played was Asteroids. This was back in the early 80s on an Atari 2600 that my cousin owned. I eventually got an NES, SNES, and finally an N64 in my teens. But that was about it. I’ve never considered myself a gamer.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BehindTheCode.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>A bin with random N64 carts is about all I have. Again, I’m not really a gamer. But when it comes to game development hardware, that’s a different story. In that area, I’m definitely a collector.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BehindTheCode.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>N64. No question.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BehindTheCode.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I’ve never really played games regularly to be honest. However, the Myst games by Cyan back in the day really got me. My siblings and I would binge those games until we finished them. Xmas holidays in the 90s were so much fun.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BehindTheCode.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My go to is an ice-cold Heineken beer, but every other weekend I’ll mix things up and have a Rum  N’ Coke to take the edge off.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BehindTheCode.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>That’s a tough one for me….🤔</p>
	<p>It would definitely be a development unit. I’d have to say my 64DD development kit, which entails a Partner-N64 dev cartridge, an N64 debugger console, and a 64DD development drive with the blue bezel. A beauty of a machine, I must say.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BehindTheCode.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Regarding development hardware, yes, indeed. Right now, I’m on the hunt for a Hudson Soft Turbo GFX-16 dev kit called the “HU7 PC Engine development kit”.</p> 
	<p>The desire to obtain these kits, atleast for me, has always been the fun of figuring out how to get them working again. I’ll repair the unit electronics if need be, track down software, and sometimes even reverse engineer parts of the system to get something up and running. </p>
	<p>I then perform a functional demo of the system on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BehindTheCode_wGerry">my YouTube channel</a> to show how the system was used by the original developers. The HU7 dev kit would be an amazing device to demo on my channel one day.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games in particular, regarding the recent N64 Recomp projects?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BehindTheCode.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Yes for sure! Anything and everything!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BehindTheCode.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Pepperoni, mushrooms and Bacon.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BehindTheCode.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I would have to say my SGI Onyx supercomputer from 1993 that I obtained. These Onyx systems were used in the very early stages of N64 game development (i.e, Rare Ltd.) primarily because the N64 game consoles themselves had not been built yet and were still in the design phase. Obtaining this unit set me back the price of a small country, and I almost put my back out moving it, as it weighs in around 200 lbs!</p>
	<p>Regardless, all I can say is Wow! It is such a cool system to own.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Finally: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BehindTheCode.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Including Dev consoles:  (x30) possibly more.</p>
	<p>Atari 2600, Nintendo NES, SNES, SNES Cartdev, N64, Partner-N64, 64DD, 64DD Dev, Gameboy, Gameboy IS-CGB-Emulator, DS, 3DS, IS-Snake-Box, Partner-CTR Debugger.</p>
	<p>Sega Master System, GG, GG dev board, Genesis, 32X CartDev, Saturn, Saturn CartDev, Dreamcast, Dreamcast Katana.</p>
	<p>Xbox, Xbox debugger, XBoX 360 dev kit.</p>
	<p>Sony PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4. And probably more.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Thank you very much for your time and being part of ReCollect64 chats!</p></div>

	<p>Gerry has some seriously cool and unique pieces in his arsenal, including that legendary SGI workstation! _BehindTheCode is consistently providing fascinating content regarding N64 development and prototype hardware from all manner of companies.</p>
	<p>I particularly like his tutorial series' on how to use Blender with N64, how to connect a DR V64 to a windows PC, and the informative looks at hardware such as the N64 Intelligent Systems NU64 Flash Gang writer, Rare's security adapter and the Partner-N64 dev kit.</p>
	<p>If you haven't already given BehindTheCode a follow, I highly recommend that you do, because you'll learn a heck of a lot from his videos!</p>
