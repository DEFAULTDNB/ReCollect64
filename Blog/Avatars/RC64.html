	<p>For this, the final Q&A chat for the forseeable future, I will begin by describing a little about myself and what I do.</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/RC64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My name is Ben, I've also been known as "KiiWii" on Nintendo hacking sites, "DEFAULTDNB" on music production and PlayStation hacking sites, and most recently "ReCollect64" on my very own Nintendo 64 site!</p>
	<p>I started out ReCollect64 around 18 months ago, with the sole intention of covering anything and everything to do with Nintendo 64. It's been an incredibly interesting adventure so far, and I still have plenty of plans for its future too; however, I think the Q&A chat section has come to a natural end, and people weren't so fussed about them, based on polls, so I have decided to wind it down with me, myself, interviewing me, myself.</p></div>

	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/RC64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I remember a few things really shaping my view of video games and computers in general. First and foremost, when I was at primary school, I was chosen to do a computer class where we had a turtle connected to a PC which we used to draw basic shapes and get it to come back to us on a path. I now know it was a BBC computer and a Valiant Turtle, and according to that timeline, I must barely have been just eight or nine years old. I'm still not sure why I was chosen for that, but I remember a text-based game called Martello Tower, which I didn't really like. Perhaps that's why I don't like turn-based/RPG heavy games today.</p>
	<p>At the same primary school, we used to play a two-dimensional snooker-style game on the BBC computers for maths lessons, which was about angles, distance and power. I used to absolutely love that game. A neighbour gave my family a BBC Micro around then too, because he heard I was into computers, and we used to key in lines and lines of code for what felt like hours to get some janky 3-second rocket animation with some horrid strobing flashing effects. I remember some friends had a C64 too, which was way better for games. We used to play <i>Double Dragon</i> and <i>Chase HQ</i> a lot. Another friend had an Amiga with <i>Jim Power in Mutant Planet</i> and <i>Fire and Ice</i>, which definitely began my love for platform games. Slightly after that, I visited my cousin who had an NES with <i>Super Mario 3</i>; that was the first time I really wanted a proper console of my own, but it wasn't until the SNES and <i>Super Mario World</i> that I would have a Nintendo console. Instead, we ended up getting an Amstrad GX4000, which, I'm not going to lie, was actually an awesome console. I grew up on <i>Burning Rubber, Batman The Movie, Operation Thunderbolt, Barbarian 2, Fire & Forget, Plotting</i> and <i>Robocop 2</i>.</p></div>

	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/RC64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>As a collector of Nintendo 64 game cartridges and having alphabetised and catalogued 99% of them, I know that I only need <b>TWO</b> games to complete my world set collection (every title released in PAL/NTSC-U/NTSC-J regions). Those games are <i>Mario no Photopi</i> and <i>Clay Fighter: Sculptor's Cut</i>, two games which will set me back around £1500 in total to procure at today's prices, even without the boxes.</p>
	<p>Including those 386 carts, I would estimate that I have 700+ in total, which includes lots of regional variants. I am attempting to collect all PAL (done), USA and JPN games released first and foremost, with other regions such as ASI/ASM, ITA, SCN, NOE, HOL, etc, and the Brazilian releases following closely behind. There are so many; it will take years, but I'm heavily financially (and spiritually) invested now, so there is no turning back!</p>
	<p>I also have a few 3DS, DC, GC, Wii, PS2 and Switch games in my collection too. I try to be selective with those, but games like <i>Metroid Prime Trilogy</i>, <i>Twilight Princess, Mario Sunshine, F-Zero GX, Wind Waker, Luigi's Mansion, MGS: Twin Snakes</i>, <i>Silent Scope, Tekken 5</i> and <i>Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis</i> are definitely in there, amongst other things. The Wii and Switch collections are strictly first party too, I avoid "shovelware" at all costs.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/RC64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>The Nintendo 64 is the one that consistently draws me back. There is something about the era it was a part of and the games that formed its library that really resonate with me. No other console has come close, except perhaps the Wii because Wii Sports and the like were phenomenal, and I'm a really competitive person.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/RC64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I play a lot of FPS games on my Nintendo 64, mainly the <i>Turok</i> games, <i>GoldenEye</i> and <i>Perfect Dark</i>. I have recently reviewed all three Turok titles as they were also released on PS5, and they have reinforced to me just how good the core elements of these games truly were. I hate the treatment that <i>GoldenEye 007</i> was given when it was re-released on Nintendo Switch and Xbox; it's a travesty just how bad that release was and how good it should have been given the raw N64 cartridge ROM runs better and has fewer issues. I wish Nightdive Studios could have been granted those rights.</p>
	<p>Annually, I replay <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i>; it's a game I got for Christmas in 1997, and it's become a total nostalgia bomb for me, especially the wintery tracks. It also takes me back to a time when DLC wasn't a thing, everything was on cart, and games played beautifully for up to 4 players huddled around one system. I need to replay Ocarina of Time too; I have a mate who replays it every year, and I have yet to revisit it on the N64 since 2012's 3DS version.</div>

	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/RC64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Recently I have been snacking on yoghurt walnuts and blueberries, but in general I try not to snack. I only drink non-fizzy zero-sugar drinks, like Vimto squash. I get through 1-2 litres every day.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/RC64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I have always regarded my fully boxed Dr V64 add-on for the Nintendo 64 as my highest prized possession. I bought it in the late 90s and used to buy sketchy CDs full of the latest games off a bloke every few months. Nowadays it's easier to just use an EverDrive 64, but back then it felt like alchemy to connect together a memory card adaptor and console connector, an NTSC colour transcoder, a step-down power supply, a donor cart, add in extra sticks of RAM for loading bigger games and then play N64 games off a CD... it was a differnt time back then!</p>
	<p>My other great possession is a collective of Amiibo (yes, that's the plural). I have every Amiibo to date, first print, and boxed as immaculately as possible. I even have the Qbby Box Boy one, Mega Yarn Yoshi, all the Power-Up bands, and the lesser collected double and triple packs for various releases. The only ones I don't have are the various, yet excruciatingly limited edition, gold and silver <i>Monster Hunter</i> prize ones. I don't think I'll ever own those though...</div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/RC64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I have a rather obscure shortlist of things I would like to own, and, in no particular order, they are the Nintendo 64 DD, Panasonic Q, Tri Star 64, Mr Backup Z64, Dr V64 Junior, the power glove for Nintendo 64, and the Madcatz dual joystick controller. Most of these I would like to experience and review, but the 64DD is my ultimate unicorn. I've never even seen one IRL.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games in particular, regarding the recent N64 Recomp projects?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/RC64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>There are so many games, but I think the big hitters such as <i>F-Zero X</i>, <i>Banjo-Tooie</i>, <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i>, <i>Donkey Kong 64</i>, <i>Conker's Bad Fur Day</i>, <i>Blast Corps</i> and definitely <i>Wave Race 64</i> would be amazing to see running natively and with ultrawide screen modes and enhanced frame rates. Imagine the re-textures and mods too!</p>
	<p>I can't wait for the day that any ROM can be chucked into the N64: Recompiled folder and natively run to some degree. There are lots of games that aren't even being decompiled yet, so waiting years is definitely not preferable to this ingenious static recompilation method.</div>

	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what's your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/RC64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I'm a boring pizza person, which is part of the reason I used this question for the Q&A chats. I love a barbecue sauce base with chicken and pineapple as my main go-to. Controversial, I know.</p>
	<p>Based on what the 45 other Q&A participants put, I think I need to try bacon with sausage and either extra cheese or some sort of peppers on it. Those seems to be the three most mentioned when asked about pizza toppings!</div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/RC64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I'm tight. Really tight. My budget is usually £5-10 per cart max, but I've managed to score a few great deals whilst hunting around for my collection. The best deal I can remember was picking up a bundle for £90 with about 20 games in, taking out the 4 or 5 I really wanted from it and selling the rest back on for £85. The main games I took from it were the MK titles, which included <i>Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero</i>. That alone was worth about £25 or £30 at the time. I was pretty happy with that whole transaction.</p>
	<p>I also paid £110 for <i>Snowboard Kids 2</i>, which was only to complete my 247 PAL cart collection, which felt like a heck of a lot, but I used an eBay voucher and managed to get 20% off that. These days it will set you back nearer £200-£250 unboxed.</div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Lastly: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/RC64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>For N64s I own a JPN grey, two PAL grey consoles (one disassembled), Funtastic red/orange/green/grape/smoke/blue and the clear/blue and clear/red JPN ones, a JPN gold console, a JPN blue Pikachu console and the Analogue 3D with several flash carts. As for other consoles, I own a Game Boy, DS, 3DS (boxed Majoras Mask Edition), PSTV (hacked), Steam Deck, an OG Xbox (chipped), Xbox 360 (Jungle Flashed), Sega Saturn (Pseudo Saturn), Dreamcast (dreamshell), 2 PS3s (one hacked 3.55), 3 PS4s (one pro on 6.72, one on latest, and ones a test kit), 2 PS5s (one phat on 3.20 one pro on latest), 2 Nintendo Switch OG (one hacked, one on 19.x.x but hackable), a Nintendo Switch 2 (latest FW), a gaming laptop which I rarely use, 2 gaming mini PC's (mainly for light gun gaming), 3 RPi-based consoles for retro gaming (PSX/N64/DC), NeoGeo/NES/SNES/Mega Drive/C64 mini consoles, the OG Evercade handheld (EverSD), Anbernic RG 406V, and an AYANEO Air!</p></div>

	<div class="pro"><p><b>So there it is. The very last Q&A chat for the site, marking the end of this feature of the site. I hope it gave you something interesting to read, and some new N64-related people to follow throughout the last 18 months!</p>
	<p>I would like to say a massive thank you to all who have ever taken part in the Q&A chats for ReCollect64; it was a light-hearted, easy way of finding out some fun information without being too invasive. I have met some fantastic people along the way, and I will continue to follow them, supporting their N64-related endeavours.</p>
	<p>Special congrats to Emu_Kidid for topping the ongoing contest charts with a whopping 68 consoles owned! Honourable mentions go to Syncoplay and VG Esoterica for their collections too!</p>
	<p>Thank you to all who read them too; without you reading, sharing and commenting on the posts on my social pages, the world would be pretty quiet. I appreciate everyone's support in helping ReCollect64 to refine itself and achieve its absolute best for the community.</p>
	<p>ReCollect64 will be back with new content, news, reviews and much, much more in the new year!</b></p></div>
