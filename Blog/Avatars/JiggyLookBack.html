	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat! Let's kick-off this Q&A by describing your presence on social media for people:</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JiggyLookBack.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I am a YouTuber who goes by Jiggylookback. I create content focusing mostly about Mysteries-lore-and theories of retro games as well as analysis and reviews. The titles I primarily focus on are by the company Rare, but I do dive into other companies as well. .</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JiggyLookBack.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I got into gaming when I was about 4 years old. My friend’s older sister had a Sega Genesis and we played Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and 2 and Golden Axe on it. Then for Christmas of 1999 I got a Nintendo 64 with Donkey Kong 64.</p>
	<p>Sonic and DK always have had a place in my heart since then. I always play those games good or bad. And then the evolution of Donkey Kong 64 for me was Banjo Tooie. And Banjo Tooie went on to become one of my favorite games of all time!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JiggyLookBack.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I have 30+ N64 games, 70+ GameCube Games, 20+ Dreamcast Games, 60+ Gameboy games, 50+ Switch games, some DS and 3DS titles, some original Xbox titles, a few PS2, PS3, and PS5 titles, and a bunch of PS4.</p>
	<p>And on top of this a massive digital library on PlayStation, Steam, and Switch.</p>
	<p>I also have a bunch of figures relating to games I love like Banjo Kazooie, Rayman, Conker’s Bad Fur Day. Things to make my background pop. </p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JiggyLookBack.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>The Nintendo 64 for sure.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JiggyLookBack.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I don’t go a year without playing through Donkey Kong 64 and Banjo Tooie.</p>
	<p>On a daily basis you can find me playing a retro title as well as a modern release. Currently I am playing through Crash Bandicoot on PS1 again and also playing a lot of Red Dead Redemption 2. </p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JiggyLookBack.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Coffee is the life blood that fuels the dreams of champions. If I’m snacking…it’s probably Oreos. </p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JiggyLookBack.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I have quite a few titles that are worth a pretty penny, but one I find the most fun is I have Samba De Amigo on Sega Dreamcast with the Miracas and dance pad. It’s hilarious.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JiggyLookBack.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I really want to acquire all of the Resident Evil Titles on GameCube. It may be the only console that has all of the classic Resident Evils on it. There is also a chainsaw controller…not kidding, look it up.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games in particular, regarding the recent N64 Recomp projects?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JiggyLookBack.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I mean if I had a dream…Banjo Tooie. I am so looking forward to that game being unlocked and getting weird things like Ultrawide support. Currently there aren’t even any rom hacks on that game due to Rare’s tricky development security features.</p>
	<p>My body is ready.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JiggyLookBack.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Chicken, onions, and BBQ sauce :P</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JiggyLookBack.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Most expensive purchases in general have been the Sega Dreamcast games. I’d say when I purchased several games at a retro gaming convention…I must have spent like 300 dollars.</p>
	<p>I got titles like Death Crimson OX, Heavy Metal, Evil Dead Hail to the King and a few more. </p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Lastly: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/JiggyLookBack.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Currently in my collection I have a Nintendo 64 (Gold), Nintendo GameCube (I have 2 colors indigo and Black), Sega Dreamcast, an original Xbox, an Xbox 360 slim, a PS4, a PS5, a Game boy color (atomic purple) Gameboy Advance (blue) a custom gameboy advance (metal and silver) a gameboy advance sp (blue), a DSi, a Luigi 25th anniversary 3DS, a Nintendo Switch Oled.</p>
	<p>So currently 15.</p>
	<p>I have lost my PS2 and PS3 so I’m looking to reacquire them in the near future.</p></div>
