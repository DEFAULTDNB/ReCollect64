		<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Foslerfer AKA The Perfect Dark Girl. Please, tell us a bit about yourself.</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>I'm here to express my love for Perfect Dark/Zero and archive as much information as I can about the Perfect Dark franchise. I can recognize that my love for the series is maybe a little bit out there. My ultimate goal on the interwebs is to show other folks like me to allow ourselves to be authentic to who we are, regardless of if it can be considered weird or maybe means loving Perfect Dark a bit too much.</p></div>
		<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
		<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>I must have been really young when I first started gaming. I'm younger than most people in the retro gaming community, born in 2005. But I was 12 when I started playing Perfect Dark and talking a lot in online forums. My first collection was my current one, sparked by a single Perfect Dark Zero polo shirt, fueled by some awesome encouraging people in the Perfect Dark community.</p></div>

		<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>All stuff somehow relates to the Perfect Dark series. Copies, Magazines, Clothes, dolls, posters. You name it, I have it with Joanna Dark on it. Oh, and of course; 108 Copies of Perfect Dark Zero.</p></div>
		<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
		<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>Hard to say, I love the 64, But I love the Xbox 360 too. If you had a Falcon 2 to my head, I'd have to say 360. Maybe the N64 is just a little before my time. But it is very, very close.</p></div>
		<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
		<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>Believe it or not (and this is a shocker) mostly Perfect Dark and Perfect Dark Zero. I play some other games like Grabbed By The Ghoulies, Goldeneye 007. But I spend most of my time on PD. There is always something new to upload to the Data Uplink in my brain.</p></div>
		<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
		<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>Probably my Perfect Dark Vinyl record. It's not particularly rare, but it's a really neat thing, gifted to me by a really neat person. Not a whole lot of my stuff is particularly valuable (I maybe spent $600 on everything in total) But it's really sentimental to me, and much of it is gifts from awesome 64 players and PD lovers.</p></div>

		<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>Perfect Dark Zero recorder pen. There is so little about it out there that it's like it doesn't exist. And I'm still looking for more pictures from the “Meet Joanna Dark” event in 2000. Not a lot of this stuff is well documented, which is why I feel like it's my duty to document whatever I can.</p></div>
		<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
		<p>Are you looking forward to Perfect Dark via N64 Recomp?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>I may not be super up to date with my knowledge when it comes to this sort of thing, but any way to make Perfect Dark easier to play and experience makes me happy. After all, it's projects like N64Recomp that keep the community alive and well!</p></div>

		<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>Peperoni. Onions. Red Peppers. It's weird, but it's tasty. Pizza is my favorite food.</p></div>
		<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
		<p>How many games consoles do you own?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>3. I used to have 6 but I had to sell a few to acquire some extra funds for kittens who were born recently.</p></div>

		<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>Probably the Perfect Dark Initiative Reboot dev t-shirt. I have one of the only ones, as a non-dev… I think. I spent like 350 on it. Sadly it has faded quite a bit 🙁</p></div>
		<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
		<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
		<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
		<p>Monsters, pizza, and more monsters. But I gotta keep it under control if I want to keep up the whole Joanna Dark look.</p></div>
		<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
		<p>Thank you very much for your time and being part of the ReCollect64 Q&A chats!</p></div>

		<p>108 copies of Perfect Dark is certainly something! I fully respect the dedication to the cause of collecting! 
		<p>If you don't already follow The Perfect Dark Girl on Twitter or YouTube I highly recommend that you do, because all of her Perfect Dark/N64 content is definitely worth checking!
