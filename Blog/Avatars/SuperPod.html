	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Aaron from SuperPodSaga! Let's kick-off this Q&A by describing your presence on social media for people:</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperPod.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I am the host of a video game podcast—SuperPod Saga, and I also run a podcast/blog network site—SuperPod Network. I'm on Bluesky, Instagram, and Discord and I tend to post a lot of memes and stuff about my favorite games or games that I'm currently playing. SuperPod Network is a community of cool gaming enthusiasts who blog together, podcast together, stream together, and more!</p></div>

	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperPod.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I think I REALLY got into gaming when my step dad bought a PS1. I played a lot of Final Fantasy 7, King's Field, and Resident Evil. I was in elementary school at the time, so I didn't get anywhere in those games. The following generation I got a GameCube for my birthday and that's where I did a good majority of my childhood gaming. Mainly with Sonic Adventure, Custom Robo, and Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperPod.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I've recently sold a good bunch of my retro collection, but I will NEVER get rid of my DS and 3DS collection. It's mostly RPGs on both systems, with my most prized ones being Chrono Trigger, Yo-Kai Watch 3, and Dragon Quest V. </p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperPod.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>If there's one console that I'm absolutely OBSESSED with, it's the GameCube. A gigantic chunk of my formative years in gaming were on that thing. In fact, the first Zelda game that I've ever beaten, Wind Waker, was one of my fondest memories. And of course I played a lot of Smash Melee with my friends, Soul Calibur 2 (WITH LINK), and I put A LOT of time in Crystal Chronicles. I grinded the heck outta that game.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperPod.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I play Smite with my brother-in-law almost every night, and we've been playing together for almost 5 years! I come back to Earthbound, Final Fantasy 9, and Chrono Cross for another playthrough at least once a year. Those are definitely my top 3 favorite games.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperPod.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Coffee. Lots and lots of coffee! I don't normally eat when playing games. It's weird, I know.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperPod.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I have a pretty sweet Amiibo collection, with some of my favorites being Diddy Kong, Wario, and even the Diablo 3 Loot Goblin. If I had to pick a game, I'd say Yo-Kai Watch 3. It was one of the last few games released for the 3DS and had a very limited release, so it's become REALLY rare. </p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperPod.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I haven't collected retro games in a while. But if I had a hunk of money burning a hole in my pocket, I'd snatch-up either Blue Dragon: Awakened Shadow or Drone Tactics, both on DS.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games in particular, regarding the recent N64 Recomp projects?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperPod.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Looks like a good majority of awesome N64 games have already been recompiled. But if there's one that still isn't available on other platforms, it'd be Ogre Battle 64. I know it was on the Wii and Wii-U VC, but those are caput now.</p></div>

	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperPod.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Sausage, green peppers, and mushrooms!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperPod.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I bought Lunar: Silver Star Harmony on PSP for like $150. SHEEEEEESH. The price dropped soon after I’d bought it.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>And Finally: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperPod.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>17 total. That'd be Xbox, Xbox 360 Slim, Xbox One and One S, Xbox Series X and S, GameCube, Wii-U, SNES, NES, New 3DS XL, PSP, NeoGeo Mini, N64, PS2, PSOne, Dreamcast </p></div>
