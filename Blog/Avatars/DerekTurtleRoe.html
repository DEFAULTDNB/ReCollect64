	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Derek "Turtle" Roe! Lets kick-off this Q&A telling people how you would describe your presence on social media?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/DerekTurtleRoe.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My main focus has always been education and preservation. But besides that, I also just like posting about gaming, tech, and posting photos of my pets or what I'm eating, since I'm a bit of a foodie. 🤤</p>
	<p>But my focus is always on making free and open-source software that either helps me with my goals, or helps others with their own goals. Then after that, public domain preservation and extensive documentation. N64DB, N64Docs, and contributing to things like TCRF, No-Intro, Redump, TOSEC, LostMediaWiki, PCGamingWiki, etc. are my main focus. I also do social media and live streaming consulting as well as security and privacy consulting too. Those are very important to me. 😄</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/DerekTurtleRoe.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I got into gaming before I could walk! My dad sat me on his lap and would let me play NES games like Super Mario Bros., Zelda 1 and 2, DuckTales, and a few others. I've been a big 'ol nerd ever since. 🤣</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/DerekTurtleRoe.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Unfortunately right now it doesn't look like much of anything. A while back I lost my job and in order to stay afloat I had to sell everything in my collection, as well as a lot of things outside my collection. What I have right now is just maybe .01% of what I use to have. I really miss collecting, but it also taught me about sacrifice and it made me make difficult choices about what I really care about. It also made me care much more about emulation and preservation, so I guess it was a good thing in retrospect.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/DerekTurtleRoe.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>People might think the N64 is my favorite, but actually it is probably a tie between the SNES and PS1. Both systems had such an amazing library of games that really impacted me as a kid, as well as an adult. 😄</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/DerekTurtleRoe.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My most played games are probably Paladins (multiplayer FPS hero shooter with moba mechanics), Skyrim and Fallout 3, Vampire Survivors, and Phasmophobia. I've been really addicted to Vampire Survivors lately, the newest DLC has been a true gem and I love it. 😄</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/DerekTurtleRoe.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Frankly lately I'm lucky if I can eat at all, but if I had to pick a snack to always have it might be Totino's pizza rolls. I love those things so much. 🤣</p>
	<p>But I also love sweets, so Starburst gets a mention as well. 👀</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/DerekTurtleRoe.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Honestly, most of my prized possessions I had to sell off a while back like I said before. I still have my Skyrim collectors edition, which means a lot to me. My GTA trilogy, Skyrim, and Fallout physical walkthrough guidebooks, which are really nice to have sometimes. I still have some things from the GTA V collectors edition which was an amazing game, even though it feels like Rockstar would treat it like Skyrim for a while, heh. I don't have much, which as I said before bums me out. I'd love too start collecting again, but who knows if I'll ever have the money or space to do that ever again.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/DerekTurtleRoe.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Yes, for sure. I want to acquire a lot of things for the N64, like the SharkWire online keyboard, iQue, backup devices like the Doctor V64, stuff like that. But outside the N64, I do still want to take a look at some development kits and homebrew stuff, like the Net Yaroze system and the SGI computers of the time period. 😄</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games in particular, regarding the recent N64 Recomp projects?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/DerekTurtleRoe.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I'm excited for a potential Dinosaur Planet decompilation or recompilation. I've always wanted to play a "real" version of that, it seemed very ambitious game for the system. If not that, then Vigilante 8/Second Offense is my favorite racing game for the system. Maybe one of the Castlevania games, to fix that frame rate and input latency 🤣</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/DerekTurtleRoe.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>This might be controversial but...Canadian bacon and pineapple. Bacon bits if I had to put one more thing on it. 😅</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/DerekTurtleRoe.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Oh gosh...I think the most I ever spent on anything was my PS3, which I had to buy a new TV for as well. I saved up for months prior just to get the TV I needed for it, and the PS3 itself was...$600. 😱</p>
	<p>The TV was $350. Plus I bought another controller and a couple games. So all together close to $1200. I come from a poor family, so spending that much on something was foreign to me, but I got so much use out of that thing, I used it as my game console and computer for school during high school! 😄</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>And Finally: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/DerekTurtleRoe.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Currently, I own an N64 (of course) and...that's it. I am forced to emulate everything else. I don't think a MiSTer counts, does it? If so you can add that.</p>
	<p>If money and space weren't obstacles, I'd have every system imaginable. I love video games, and I would love to one day start a nonprofit for preserving games and maybe own a museum. Dreams of a nostalgic nerd for now, though. 😌</p></div>

	<p>Thank you very much for your time and being part of ReCollect64 chats!</p></div>

	<p>Derek "Turtle" Roe is an incredibly talented individual who has contributed heaps to the N64 scene in terms of information and preservation! He has also very kindly helped me out a number of times, most recently to help me complete the <a title="64JS ROM TOOL" href="64JS.html" target="_blank">64JS ROM information tool</a>.</p>
	<p>It cannot be understated just how excited I am to see N64DB and how it progresses in the future, so if you would like to give him a follow, and I highly recommend that you do, you can find his social links below:</p>
