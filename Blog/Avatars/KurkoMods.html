	<p>Welcome to ReCollect 64! Lets kick-off this Q&A telling people how you would describe yourself on social media?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Kurko_Mods.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Right now my social media (Twitter, Instagram, threads & TikTok) are focused on entertaining people with retro content from the 90s/Early's 00s. Every day I make 2 different posts, one is some old commercial or beta video, and the other is a comparison between two games. I love reading people's opinions on each game, and why they prefer one or the other. On the other hand, every month I restore 25 retro arts, which I use to make these "one or another" publications, and I also publish 25 Wallpapers and 25 phone backgrounds I make using these restored retro arts, but that is exclusive for the people who support me on Patreon and Youtube membership. And finally, I also continue working on my own Banjo Kazooie projects and try to record videos about other people's projects for YouTube.</p></div>

	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Kurko_Mods.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I started playing when I was 5 years old, when my parents bought one of those NES clones in 1993. For several years I only had one cartridge that included a handful of games like Pacman, Contra, Super Mario Bros, Mappy, Arkanoid etc. I remember that about 1995 they bought SMB3, and that was all until Christmas 1999 when I was finally able to buy N64 with the money I had saved for a long time.I remember drawing Super Mario comics, and imagining designing Banjo Kazooie levels by drawing them on a sheet of paper. I also remember drawing a lot of Zelda, and designing a board game that I never finished. I guess all of that was a bit of a seed for wanting to later dedicate myself to developing video games.</p></div>

	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Kurko_Mods.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I'm not a big retro collector, possibly the console I have the most games on is the N64. I remember buying a lot of second-hand games in the early 00s, before the whole retro boom sent prices skyrocketing. </p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Kurko_Mods.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>N64, without a doubt. It is the console that I have the most love for everything it meant to me, and for what it cost me to get it. However, I think that right now Nintendo Switch is the best console that has ever existed</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Kurko_Mods.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I don't have much time to play, so I don't usually replay many games. However, from time to time I always play Zelda Ocarina of Time.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Kurko_Mods.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>If you mean prized possession for me, the N64. I think it's the only console I have that I wouldn't sell for anything in the world. If you mean prized with real value, maybe Conker, since I have it with a box in good condition, or the collector's version of Skyward Sword with the golden WiiMote</p></div>				
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Kurko_Mods.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>As I already told you, I'm not a big game collector. However, I would like to have some Japanese N64 games with box included. Super Mario 64, the two Zelda and the two Banjo to give a few examples.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games via N64 Recomp?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Kurko_Mods.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I was trying out Majora just the other day, and I quite liked the experience, so I guess when Ocarina is available it will be time to play it again lol</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Kurko_Mods.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Meat, cheese and barbecue sauce. I'm pretty simple haha</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty gaming purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Kurko_Mods.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Currently, it's probably my PC, but it's not a high-end PC or anything</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Kurko_Mods.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>As for international snacks, I have always been a big fan of Doritos. And now there are some snacks that are made here in Spain called Jumpers that are really delicious!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Finally: How many games consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Kurko_Mods.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I have the NES clone, two N64s, Wii, Ps2, Ps3, Xbox360, WiiU, Nintendo Switch, NDS and N3DS. So 10, 11 counting the second N64. I don't have a Gamecube because I had to sell it years ago due to lack of money.</p></div>
