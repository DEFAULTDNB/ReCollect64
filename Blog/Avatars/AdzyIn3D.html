	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Adam! Let's kick-off this Q&A by describing your presence on social media for people:</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/AdzyIn3D.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I'm a Youtuber! I pretty much strictly make GoldenEye 007 Content and I'm mainly known for my Tierlists and Funny Moments.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/AdzyIn3D.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I started gaming when I was 2 years old! My Mum was the one that got me into GoldenEye 007 as she was a massive fan of the movies and video game. But I did start my adventure gaming on the PlayStation and Sega Saturn.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/AdzyIn3D.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I've been lucky to keep everything I had growing up so I have a decently sized "Retro Collection". Mostly from anything under the Sixth Generation of consoles.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/AdzyIn3D.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I would say the Nintendo 64 but the PlayStation 1 would be a close Second!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/AdzyIn3D.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I don't really keep up with many modern releases I just stick to what I've always played such as. GoldenEye 007, Dead Space, Left 4 Dead, Mortal Kombat.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/AdzyIn3D.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Can't beat a good Vegemite sandwich with a nice cold drink!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/AdzyIn3D.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I would say all of my complete boxed Nintendo 64 games would be the main thing.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/AdzyIn3D.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I would say the GoldenEye 007 Beta.... Hopefully one day!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games in particular, regarding the recent N64 Recomp projects?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/AdzyIn3D.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I can't wait for the GoldenEye 007 Recomp! Another one was Mario Kart 64 that recently was released and I'm having a blast with it.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/AdzyIn3D.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I would say anything with MEAT!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/AdzyIn3D.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I would say my Left 4 Dead 2 (2009) Gaming Heads Tank Statue! I found it for a really good price and it sells for about 20x the price I paid. That was a solid pickup for sure. Calling 2009 "Retro" is so weird!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Lastly: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/AdzyIn3D.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Alrighty! So I own Nintendo 64 (PAL), Nintendo 64 (JPN) , Sega Saturn (PAL), PlayStation 1 ,  PlayStation (ONE), PlayStation 2, PlayStation 2 (SLIM), PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Original, Xbox 360 (ARCADE), Xbox 360 (SLIM), Xbox One, Nintendo Gamecube, Nintendo Wii, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, Super Nintendo, Nintendo Gameboy, I think that is all of them.</p></div>

	<p>AdzyIn3D is an avid fan of GoldenEye 007's surface level, and he makes some awesome content on YouTube, including tier lists for things such as weapons and skyboxes in <i>GoldenEye 007</i>. There is also a great video on Adzy's honest rankings of the OEM N64 controllers, as well as a load of playthroughs of various games, including the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b197">GoldenEye Tournament Edition ROM hack</a> and even the cancelled GoldenEye remaster.</p>
	<p>On top of all this, Adam also makes hilarious clips and skillshot shorts, which are well worth a look, so I advise you all to check out all of his content and more over on his social channels below!</p>
