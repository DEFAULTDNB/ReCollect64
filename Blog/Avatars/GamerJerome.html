	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Jerome! Let's kick-off this Q&A by describing your presence on social media for people:</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/GamerJerome.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My name is Jerome. I go by gamerjerome on most social media sites. You can find me on Twitter, Bluesky, Discord, Youtube and Reddit. I have a lot of hobbies so my posts can be random at times. I'm also currently a moderator on the TaoStyx64 Discord</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/GamerJerome.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I've been into gaming since I could first remember. My family had an Atari when I was really little. In the late 80's we got an NES. We would rent games almost every weekend. Although I could never beat Festers Quest. The SNES was the first console I got to call my own. I spent most of my time playing Mario Paint, Zelda and trying to beat Stunt Race FX.</p>
	<p>In the 90's some straight line winds and hail came through town and turned my sisters house into a cheese grater. I helped them put on new siding. In return they bought me the new at the time N64 and Turok. My fondest memory was playing Goldeneye 007 four player split screen on a 13" TV for 7 hours straight. Mtn Dew and Doritos were sure on the scene.</p>
	<p>The PS2 was the first console I paid with my own money. Also the first console I waited overnight inline for. The rest is history.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/GamerJerome.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>It's not the biggest collection but also not the smallest. I'm sitting at 43 consoles. That includes handhelds. Some are duplicates. Around 400 physical games.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/GamerJerome.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>N64 is by far my favorite console. Does it really hold up? No, but It has the most memories for me. I wish I could go back and experience playing Conkers Bad Fur Day for the first time again.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/GamerJerome.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I jump around a lot but I've been grinding some GT7 lately. I've also been playing Rise of Nations on PC again. Once a year I replay Conkers Bad Fur Day.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/GamerJerome.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I can't say I eat or drink anything specific for gaming. I do enjoy a good whisky from time to time.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/GamerJerome.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I have a few. Stunt Racer 64 Blockbuster exclusive CIB would be my biggest. I have a complete set of sealed N64 Blister Pack controllers. Very few people have a complete sealed set. I have Clay Fighter 63 1/3rd Sculptors Cut but just the cart. I also have a Steelsticks64 Joystick module #1-180.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/GamerJerome.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Getting the box and manual for Clay Fighter Sculptors Cut would be nice. Mainly because they are so rare. Although I don't chase many collectables. Most I get by chance or when they first came out.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games in particular, regarding the recent N64 Recomp projects?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/GamerJerome.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I don't follow much of the Recomps. I did try Perfect Dark. I play most of my retro games on console though. It's still interesting to see what they have been able to do though.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>You're ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what's your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/GamerJerome.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Spicy Italian Sausage, Three Cheese and Jalapenos</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/GamerJerome.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I got Stunt Racer 64 CIB for only $16 at a pawn shop. It was only worth $100 at the time but now It's a $2k+ game. I also got 19 boxed N64 games for only $10 at a garage sale once. That's a once in a life time find.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>And Finally: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/GamerJerome.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>43 Total. 2x PS1, PSONE Slim, 2x PS2 Fat, PS2 Slim, PS3 Slim, PS4, PS4 Pro, 2x PS4 Pro 500 Million Edition, PS5. NES, SNES, <b>10x N64</b>, GameCube, 2x Wii, Switch, Genesis, Atari 2600, OG Xbox, DMG Gameboy, Gameboy Advanced, Gameboy SP,  Nintendo DSi, Nintendo DSi XL, 2x 3DS, New 3DS, Vita, SNES Classic, PS1 Classic, Game & Watch Super Mario Bros.</p></div>

	<p>Thank you very much for your time and being part of ReCollect64 chats!</p></div>
	</div>
	<p>Jerome has an vast and varied console selection and some fiercely rare Blockbuster/USA-exclusive N64 games that I still need to complete my world-set collection!</p>
	<p>I highly recommend checking out the TaoStyx64 discord, where there is an awesome community of N64-focused people dedicated to performance controller parts such as metal buttons, steel bowls, bronze gears, joystick caps, and also merchandise, SummerCart64s and much more besides!</p>
