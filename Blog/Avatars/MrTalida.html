	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 Q&A chats MrTalida! Let's begin this Q&A by describing your presence on social media:</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/MrTalida.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I'm a retro game archivist and preservationist! I post an eclectic mix of things, like previously unseen game design documents, game source code, and other odds and ends. My most recent preservation effort the past couple years has been Keshi Corner, a project where I'm producing detailed 3D scans of vintage video game toy figures. I think merchandise like this is something that's rather ephemeral and it gets overlooked too often when we think about what we should be preserving from the game industry.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/MrTalida.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My first console was the Intellivision, which I think my parents picked up on a whim from Sears sometime in the 1980s. I'm not sure why; they've never been gamers! But Intellivision titles like Astrosmash and Advanced Dungeons & Dragons were my entry point into the wonderful world of video games.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/MrTalida.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I was (and AM!) a Nintendo kid, so there's lots of Mario in my collection, and lots, lots of Zelda in particular; I'm a huge Zelda fan and I've got a fairly large collection of all the games and various merchandise.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/MrTalida.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>There's so many great ones, but I think the SNES will always have a special place in my heart. I got it when I was about 7, so it's the console that occupies that special, formative period of my childhood.  And with games like Super Mario World, Link to the Past, Starfox, and countless more classics in a game library that numbers in the hundreds, it was a really special console for a lot of people, I think! What a great time in gaming...</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/MrTalida.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I just finished Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom and loved it!  I'm also playing the Advance Wars 1 & 2 remake. I've revisited Legend of Grimrock again recently, and earlier this Summer my wife and I had a blast playing the Riven remake.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/MrTalida.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Fruit snacks, by the handful!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/MrTalida.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I have some beloved gaming artifacts, like my full set of Legend of Zelda keshi gomu figures from 1986! One item that comes to mind is the super rare Twilight Princess trailer Nintendo DS game card that Nintendo gave to select attendees of E3 2005.  Mine's signed by Koji Kondo!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/MrTalida.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Someday I want that Super Mario Pinball machine Gottlieb released in the early 1990s... if only it weren't thousands of dollars!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games in particular, regarding the recent N64 Recomp projects?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/MrTalida.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I think the whole recomp scene is super exciting.  I haven't been keeping my finger to the pulse of what's been released and what's still in the works, but I nevertheless look forward to seeing N64's greatest classics augmented and revitalized as recomps!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/MrTalida.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Mushroom and sausage for sure!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/MrTalida.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I think one of the most egregiously expensive gaming items I've spent money on, from a price to size ratio, is this 2.5" tall plastic Link statue from A Link to the Past that cost $200! I really wanted to scan this rare Zelda toy to make it available to everyone, so it was worth it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/keshiCorner_LinkHoldingPot_8f1c34a1" target="_blank">HERE</a></p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>And Finally: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/MrTalida.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>NES, SNES, N64, GCN, Wii, WiiU, Switch, Switch OLED (does that count?), GBC, GBA, DS, DS Lite, DSi, 3DS, New 3DS XL, Famicom (+Disk System), TV Game 15, Intellivision, Intellivision II, CD-i, Xbox 360, Game Gear, and Tiger Gamecom! So let's call it 22.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Thank you very much for your time and being part of ReCollect64 chats!</p></div>

	<p>Mr Talida recently unearthed some incredible Quest 64 beta material regarding character information, and has demonstrated a bunch of on-cart mods including restoring lost NPC's and animations through gameshark codes!</p>
	<p>They also have their incredible Keshi resource shared freely available online, and has today shared a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrtalida.bsky.social/post/3lbgrzuzgyc2r" target="_blank">celebratory 26th anniversary post about Ocarina of Time with a stunning Keshi Gomu rubber figure</a> so if you enjoy this kind of thing, as I do, I would implore you to give them a follow!</p>
