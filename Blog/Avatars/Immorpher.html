	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Immorpher! Let's kick-off this Q&A by describing a little about yourself.</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Immorpher.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I am a 90's console shooter enthusiast, Doom 64 & Quake 1 modder, dark ambient musician, and documented 64nicator.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Immorpher.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Video games weren't popular when I was young and I don't think I even knew what a console was. But coming home from elementary school one day, I open the front door and I see both of my parents playing Super Mario on the NES. They were trying to coach each other on getting past the second level (the sewer level). I don't think they ever made it! But I sure beat that level and played so many games afterwards. My memory after that is playing Metroid and feeling like it was a living world on a NES cart. Of course that would be outdone with Super Metroid. But then it was shooters and being in first person made it feel like I was more immersed in those worlds.</p></div>

	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Immorpher.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I primarily seek out first person shooters for 90's consoles. So I have a good majority of the shooters for the N64 and Playstation 1, many of them complete in box and some of the region variants too. I will also never say no to a free game or a game less than a $1, so I have a bunch of PS2, Xbox, and oddly Xbox 360 games. I never buy sealed or graded games. Not just because game grading is a scam, but I want to open and play with them.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Immorpher.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>It has to be the Nintendo 64 since it has the best shooters on it and the cartridge format really lets us do a lot more with the console these days. I also have grown to appreciate the Sega Dreamcast. It never lived up to its potential originally, but the homebrew community has been doing amazing things with it now.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Immorpher.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I don't game every day nor for long hours at a time, but I have quite a few games in my rotation. Namely Doom 64, Quake, Amid Evil, Prodeus, and Super Metroid. It's easy to return to Doom 64 and Quake since the communities are always making new things for them. I also end up playing Sega Dreamcast homebrew a lot and seeing what N64 title they have just ported over. Then a few times a year I return to various shooters and N64 games for more nostalgia!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Immorpher.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>These days I game after dinner so no snacks for me. As a teen, in the basement, it used to be mountain dew and nacho cheese doritos though! That is until the ultimate leech, Geoff Keighley, ruined it for us all. I do worry about modern gamers when they use energy drinks when gaming; that can't be good for their health! But I can't complain too much because of what I used to eat wasn't great either.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Immorpher.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I have Doom 64 in box for both the North America and Japan releases! It is not my most expensive gaming possession, but it means the most to me.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Immorpher.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I would love to have a Vectrex! It is a vector-based home console and its hard to explain how visually unique it is. Only some of the older arcade machines have vector based graphics, and its hard to explain how smooth the graphics are and the natural bloom they have. Its very difficult to simulate and emulate accurately with modern tech. But the Vectrex isn't very cheap and doesn't have many games for it, so I haven't been able to justify buying one yet!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games in particular, regarding the recent N64 Recomp projects?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Immorpher.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>The shooter community has been very fortunate that most of the N64 shooters have modern ports, either made by the community or Nightdive. But what has been missing is Turok: Rage Wars and Daikatana (N64). Turok: Rage Wars because it was a N64 exclusive that focused on multiplayer, but had bots for single-player as well. And sure Daikatana had a PC release, but the N64 version was quite a bit different and did not have the bugged out companions, so it was the best version! Heck, I also wouldn't mind a Duke Nukem 64, since it had an exclusive split-screen deathmatch mode with bots that I found very hilarious as a teen.</p></div>

	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Immorpher.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I am willing to accept any blow back on this one. But the best pizza when done right is a Chicago style pizza, with italian sausage, pepperoni, and bell peppers. If I am allowed a 4th toping, it will be onions! Now if the pizza-haters out there refuse to accept Chicago style pizza then I have a second answer for them. If it is a New York style pizza, the best toppings for it are pineapple, ham, and bacon!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Immorpher.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>At a flea market I got a Sega Dreamcast with a handful of games, 3 controllers, and a memory card for only $40 about a decade ago. Around the same time, I also found Doom 64 complete in box for $20. Both were fantastic deals and I doubt I will see anything like that again in the future!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Lastly: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Immorpher.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>It seems like I have up to 21, depending on if some qualify!</p>
	<p>TI-99/4a (an old computer mostly used for gaming these days), Commodore 64 (a computer which has more games than any modern console!), Atari 2600, Intellivision Flashback (a modern mini console), Mega SG (A Genesis FPGA), Super Nintendo, Amiga 500 Mini (a modern mini console), Sony Playstation 1, Nintendo 64, Sega Dreamcast, Sony Playstation 2, Microsoft Xbox, Nintendo Wii, Sony Playstation 3, Microsoft Xbox 360, Sony Playstation 4, Nintendo Wii U, Microsoft Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Sony Playstation 5, Microsoft Xbox Series X.</p></div>
