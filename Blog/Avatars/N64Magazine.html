	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Lewis! Let's kick-off this Q&A by describing your presence on social media for people:</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/N64Magazine.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I was a writer for a couple of gaming websites several moons ago now, as well publishing bits on my own website. Lately I had the idea of @N64Magazine simply to make myself (and hopefully others) giggle, plus serve as a little tribute to the legendary British mag, and the Nintendo 64 itself. Even if you don't know what N64 Magazine was, the no-context nature of it means anyone should be able to enjoy its soothing doses of bygone gaming nostalgia.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/N64Magazine.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I received a Sega Master System for Christmas aged five, which I loved. But when this new game called 'Sonic the Hedgehog' appeared not long after, I became absolutely hooked. That spiky blue 'hog has much to answer for.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/N64Magazine.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>It's just the consoles that I enjoy, plus a sizeable gaming magazine collection. The biggest (and favourite) is for my Japanese Nintendo 64, which includes plenty of controllers and accessories too.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/N64Magazine.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My opinion changes on this. I suppose the correct answer is the Super Famicom – it's faultless in every way, really. But the Nintendo 64 is the one system which I always have plugged in and ready to go, so perhaps it's that?</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/N64Magazine.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>These days I only get to play sporadically, but whenever I do I try to work through my backlog of games I haven't finished, or (to my shame) even opened. Mario Kart 8 or SM64 Randomizer are invariably where I return to for re-playing.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/N64Magazine.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I've reached the age where I need to keep snacking to a minimum. But I confess I do still enjoy a Dairy Milk Button or three.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/N64Magazine.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I was one of the blessed few who got hold of a SteelSticks64, erm, stick. I'm sorry to report that it's glorious.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/N64Magazine.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I want for nothing. Well... most that I do have my eye on are just too expensive to justify now anyway. Ah, well.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games in particular, regarding the recent N64 Recomp projects?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/N64Magazine.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I've zero interest in playing games on PCs, so not particularly. In my limited understanding of it, it should help those clever modders in making more/better ROM hacks for native consoles too, so I'll look forward to what that brings.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/N64Magazine.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Several slices of existential dread, a pinch of amnesia, topped off with a dollop of pure cynicism.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/N64Magazine.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I handed over £250 for an imported XRGB Framemeister around the time they came out. That's for playing retro games – does it count? In my defence, I do still use it today. As for thrifty finds, I bought a boxed Japanese launch N64 with 9 boxed classic games (Mario 64, StarFox 64, etc.) all delivered for just £60. This was in the the halcyon days of bargain eBay, about 20 years ago.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>And Finally: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/N64Magazine.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>13: N64, Super Famicom, GameCube, PS2, Victor V-Saturn, Dreamcast, Nintendo DS, Wii U, GBA, Mega Drive Mini, Amiga A500 Mini, Super Famicom Mini, PlayStation Classic.</p></div>

	<p>Thank you very much for your time and being part of ReCollect64 chats!</p></div>

	<p>Lewis also runs <a href="www.fointypinger.co.uk">FointyPinger</a>, a site that hosts interesting articles, reviews, a portfolio of interesting work, and a snazzy section featuring a rundown of the top 50 rated N64 games.</p>
	<p>I heartily recommend giving N64Magazine a follow on their social links for the brilliant humour and off-the-wall obscure cherry-picked quotes. Attempting to figure out which game they're referring to not only proves intriguing but more often than not it's quite perplexing!</p>
