	<p>Today I would like to welcome none other than Graslu00 to this weeks ReCollect64 chat Q&A session! So without further adue, let's start by telling people how you would describe your presence on social media:</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I'm a YouTuber, focused mainly on classic N64 games, GoldenEye and James Bond in general. I like to share my gameplay and also help others with the games I cover or show them the best up-to-date ways to enjoy the classics.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My family got me into gaming and PC's in general - my dad would play on the N64 while giving me an unplugged controller as a kid (who didn't do this) and eventually I got old enough to give it a real go by myself. His favourites on N64 were GoldenEye, Donkey Kong 64 and Star Wars Racer. I've been involved with gaming since I have use of memory. My mom introduced me into PC's and that eventually lead into gaming there as well. It wasn't until the Xbox 360 that I got into online gaming however, Halo 3 was my first Xbox Live title back in January 2008 and that was a life changing moment which starting my online presence.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I don't exactly collect old games other than keeping the copies I've always had - I did expand a bit on those titles I was interested in and/or complete sets for a few pieces. For N64 and GameCube.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>The Nintendo 64 would be my favourite console - it's the one I still use to this day and enjoy the most, but if I had to choose one other than that it'd be the Xbox 360 for the reasons I mentioned earlier.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Outside of my YouTube work which includes playing GoldenEye, Perfect Dark and other Bond titles, I focus on multiplayer games mainly. These days I'm mostly just hopping between Fortnite, Counter-Strike and an indie game called Friends vs Friends - but in general I play a huge variety of titles. Metroid, Tekken, Resident Evil, Zelda... But I'm definitely more of a competitive player, I've had some good competitions, tournaments and leagues on my back by now.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Chocolate.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I own a signed copy of GoldenEye & Perfect Dark by the developers that I've met multiple times in the UK. Always a great experience to meet them and share some time together. The Rareware devs really are down to earth!</p></div>				
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Some day I'd love to get my hands on a beta copy of Perfect Dark & GoldenEye. I know they exist somewhere out there... Maybe one day. A few years ago it'd have been the XBLA remaster of GoldenEye but we finally got that!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any particular games via N64Recomp?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I'm especially excited about Star Fox 64 recompiled. That game must be a dream to play with native widescreen and high framerates. F-Zero X is another title that I think would be interesting to see on PC.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Wouldn't really know, I'm quite simple when it comes to pizza toppings! Anything meaty is fine by me though, kebab pizza is probably one of my favourites if I had to choose.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>The most expensive item I own in my collection (other than my PC lol) is probably the official Golden Gun prop replica, while not exactly a gaming item - it is definitely appreciated by those who played GoldenEye!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Finally: How many games consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I'd have to count... x1 RGB modded N64, x1 UltraHDMI modded N64, x1 Pikachu Edition N64, x2 Black N64, x1 Jungle Green N64, x1 Ice Blue N64, x2 Xbox 360, x1 Xbox 360 Elite, x1 Xbox 360 Slim Devkit, x1 Xbox 360 Slim RGH modded, x1 Xbox One, x1 Xbox One X, x1 Xbox Series X, x1 Switch, x1 Wii, x1 Wii U, x3 (?)
