	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Q&A Toadfan5!</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Thank you! I'm always happy to talk about games since they're such an important part of my life.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Lets begin this Q&A by telling people how you would describe your presence on social media?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>So I think a lot of the retro content being created has been focused too much on the NES and SNES, and while those consoles are excellent, I think the N64 has a lot to offer that people just genuinely don't know about. So I'd like to tell people of all the great N64 games that have gone overlooked for too long.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I've actually been playing games since I was about 3 or 4 years old. I found my sister's original Game Boy and played Super Mario Land 2 a Power Rangers game and a Barbie game (I also lost Mario Land 2 by dropping it through some floorboards) My first home console though was the N64 that I got from my grandparents for Christmas in 1998 with Yoshi's Story and NASCAR 99.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My retro collection is most filled with just the games I really like or that seem worth playing. Except for the N64 collection which is the 296 north American releases and around 40 of the Japanese exclusives, and one European exclusive...and one game that went everywhere except north America. Funny enough the console I have the most games for besides the N64 is actually the Xbox 360 which is definitely my second favorite console.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Speaking of favorites yeah of course the N64 is my favorite console. I have such good memories of it throughout so many different parts of my life. To round out my top 5 though I'd have to go Xbox 360, Dreamcast, SNES, and GameCube.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I've actually really been back into GTA 5, Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, Donkey Kong 64, Super Smash Bros Melee, and Rock Band 4.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I've actually got an autographed copy of Diddy Kong Racing DS that I won from an old Banjo Kazooie fan site called Roysten's Fishbowl! That and I got a custom Mario themed N64 that I've used practically everyday since 2015.</p></div>				
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>The N64 DD. I've wanted one since I heard about it in Nintendo Power back in like 1999. I feel like most of the games are possible to obtain someday (minus Japan Pro Golf Tour 64 and Doshin 2) but I want the actual add on so badly.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games via N64Recomp?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>If it gets more people playing more games I'm fine for any of 'em. If I had to pick one game to get the decompilation treatment though it would be Bomberman 64 the Second Attack (easily the most underrated and overlooked N64 game)</p></div>

	<p>Extra cheese, cheddar cheese, and Parmesan cheese.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">

	<p>Whatâ€™s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Clay Fighter Sculptor's Cut, and it was 325. I've also got Bangai O and Getter Love but those were around 150 each.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Oh man my favorite drink right now is a mix of Melon Soda and Root Beer, it's just such a perfect mix. Other than that I drink mostly water and Decaf Earl Gray tea when it's cold. Food wise I love cola and melon soda gummies, and some mozzarella sticks.</p></div>
