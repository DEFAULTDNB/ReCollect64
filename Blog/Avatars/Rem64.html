	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Rem64! Let's start this Q&A by describing what you do on social media.</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Rem64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I'm trying to give the Nintendo 64 a more positive look by posting whatever N64-related stuff I can find on Twitter/X and TikTok, I feel that the system gets unwarranted hate these days (specially in retro circles from what I've seen), plus I also try to give its less popular titles more attention, I've noticed a lot of the non-Nintendo/Rareware games on the system get ignored frequently or even dismissed as "bad games" and that's a shame, not everything about the N64 has to be about Mario 64 or Ocarina of Time.
	My presence is minuscule on the big sea that is the Internet but I'm fine being a small account posting how much the N64 means to me.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Rem64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>When I was a kid (maybe 5 or 6 years old) I went with my cousins to Blockbusters to rent videogames for his Nintendo 64 (had no idea what videogames were at the time), he got Mortal Kombat Trilogy and Diddy Kong Racing, I must say I was terrified of MKT (specially the fatalities) but when I saw Diddy Kong Racing for the first time I fell in love with gaming.
	My first videogame console was one of those Famiclones systems with various NES games in one cartridge,  on later years I got a PlayStation 1 and then I got a N64 for myself, I think the reason I have stuck with retro-gaming is that while everyone was busy with latest-gen games I was discovering more games on older consoles via emulation or by trading my old games in thrift stores.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Rem64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>It's not that big, I have a few original N64 games and some burned PS1 and PS2 games I bought during the 2010s. I'd like to buy more retro consoles at some point like a Game Boy or a Master System.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Rem64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>The Nintendo 64 obviously, I think a lot of the games on the system are perfect for my tastes (I'm huge on 3D platformers and Racing games) to the point I can say most of my top 10 favorite games of all time are on the N64 (Conker's BFD, Diddy Kong Racing, Mischief Makers, Star Wars Ep:1 Racer, etc...), plus I really like the aesthetics and art-style of N64 games, specially the Rareware ones.
	Other consoles I really love are the NES and the PS1.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Rem64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I usually play fighting games as they're one of my favorite genres, I like playing from the competitive to the more casual or even the bad ones, I've been playing ClayFighter Sculptor's Cut and despite not being a good fighting game at all, I still have fun with it, Bad Mr.Frosty is Baddass.
	Also like booting up random N64 games and playing them for a bit, I have found some games I had no idea they existed like Nuclear Strike 64, Chopper Attack or Puyo Puyo n Party.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Rem64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I like cookies and milk, and as basic as it sounds, water is always good.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Rem64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Probably my copies of Diddy Kong Racing, Mischief Makers and Top Gear Rally, it's not that they're super hard to find games or anything like that, but those games are very important in my life, specially DKR.
	My N64 Flashcart is also very important to me right now haha.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Rem64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Not really, maybe Mischief Makers? I remember that game being cheap for years before it got a huge increase in its Price, maybe because it got more popular as this N64 hidden gem that no one played.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games in particular, regarding the recent N64 Recomp projects?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Rem64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>The Kart-Racing games (MK64, DKR, MSUSA) for online multiplayer capabilities. But personally I'm fine with anything as long as it makes romhacking for N64 games better and bring more amazing stuff (that's console compatible, obviously).</p></div>

	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Rem64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Bacon, Chicken breast strips and Pepperoni, just give me the Texas BBQ Pizza from Domino's.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Rem64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Probably my Gaming PC.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>And Finally: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Rem64.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>6, I have a N64, a PS2, a PSP, a 2DS, a Switch Lite and a PS1, sadly the PS1 and PSP aren't working.</p></div>
