	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Ken! Let's kick-off this Q&A by describing a little about yourself.</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperChallengeGames.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I’m Ken Barnes, a web Developer, former game journalist, and owner of the online import game store SuperChallenge Ltd.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperChallengeGames.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My family got an Atari 2600 when I was 4, and we only had three games - Donkey Kong, Pole Position, and Kangaroo. Whenever the TV was free, that was my time. I’ve never looked back.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperChallengeGames.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>It’s less voluminous than it was previously, as I sold off a fair amount in order to start the store. I only keep things I really enjoy or am definitely going to play, so I’ve around 200 titles across tons of consoles.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperChallengeGames.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My heart says Dreamcast. My head says PlayStation 2. Nostalgia says Xbox 360.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperChallengeGames.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Anything and everything, though my top replays are Burnout Revenge, Burnout Takedown, and anything by PlatinumGames.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperChallengeGames.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Cherry Pepsi Max and Popchips.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperChallengeGames.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Not one in particular. I love all my children equally.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperChallengeGames.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>None that I can think of!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games in particular, regarding the recent N64 Recomp projects?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperChallengeGames.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>WWF No Mercy, Wrestlemania 2000, and International Superstar Soccer 2000..</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperChallengeGames.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>pepperoni, Cumberland sausage, bacon. Now I’m hungry.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperChallengeGames.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Most expensive is a copy of Outrun 2 SP on PS2, which I still got for a great deal. Most thrifty is a boxed Neo Geo CD from a boot sale over a decade ago. £10 because the seller thought it was faulty. Still working fine to this day!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Lastly: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SuperChallengeGames.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>29</p></div>

	<p>Based in Exeter, UK, Ken Barnes is an accomplished journalist who has written nearly 1500 articles and reviews for outlets such as PlayStation LifeStyle, Pure Xbox, and Nintendo Life, to name but a few. He has a massive <a href="https://opencritic.com/critic/960/ken-barnes">179 games reviewed on Opencritic</a> and certainly knows a thing or three about most games and consoles!</a>
	<p>Currently running Super Challenge Games, Ken is an absolute legend when it comes to stocking interesting N64-related items, retro import games and accessories for a multitude of Sega, Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo consoles. I recently purchased the N64 DD title, <i>F-Zero X Expansion Kit</i>, from his site, and I was blown away by the condition and quality of his products, as well as the speedy tracked delivery times!</p>
	<p>With a constant flow of interesting titles, sizeable offers, and staggeringly reasonable pricing, I humbly ask that if you want to expand your retro gaming collection past the selection typical to the UK shores, then this is 100% the place to shop for Japanese goodies without breaking the bank!</p>
