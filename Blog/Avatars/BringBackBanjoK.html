	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Matt! Let's kick-off this Q&A by describing your presence on social media for people:</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BringBackBanjoK.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My name is Matt. I run an account on twitter/x called @BringBackBanjoK. It’s mostly a hype account for my love for Banj-Kazooie and my wish for it to return.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BringBackBanjoK.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Honestly I’ve been gaming quite literally longer than I can remember. I don’t even have a memory of ‘my first game’. I’m told the first game I played was Konami’s X-Men arcade game with my older brothers.</p>
	<p>Probably the most significant early gaming memory for me would have been the Christmas I got my lime green game boy colour in ‘98. I’d have been about 6 years old and it was the first gaming equipment that was actually mine. I absolutely lived for the DK Land games, Wario Blast and Street Fighter 2. Prior to that I’d use my sibling’s SNES, NES and Mega Drive.</p></div>

	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BringBackBanjoK.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My big two are the Dreamcast and the N64. The steamdeck I purchased has kind of changed how I game a lot when it comes to older systems but there’s something about those two consoles in particular that never feels quite right to emulate.</p>
	<p>Lately I’ve gotten really into the Game Boy Advance. I got one with a modded screen. And since I never had one as a kid, I’ve been having a lot of fun exploring the library. SO many hidden gems.</p>
	<p>I also have a Game Boy Colour, a SNES, a 3DS, a Wii, a Wii U, an Xbox 360, an Xbox One an PS Vita and a bunch of those mini systems.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BringBackBanjoK.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>For home consoles it has to be the N64. The library is the definition of quality over quantity.</p>
	<p>For handhelds, I don’t think the 3DS gets enough credit.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BringBackBanjoK.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Every other year I make it a point to replay both of the Banjo Kazooie games. That often extends to Conker’s Bad Fur Day and DK64. There’s always other games I seem to come back to time and time again. The DKC trilogy, Dead Rising, Resident Evil 4, Earthworm Jim, Marvel vs Capcom 2 and WWF No Mercy always seem to notably recapture my attention.</p>
	<p>I don’t often talk about it on social media but I’m such a big fan of arcade beat em ups. Especially the Konami, and Capcom ones.</p>
	<p>I got pretty heavily into Multiversus, so I was sad to see the end of that.</p>
	<p>It’s also hard to kill that little Pokèmaniac in me. I’ll reliably revisit gen 1 and gen 2 Pokèmon games frequently.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BringBackBanjoK.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I don’t tend to eat or drink when I game. Is that weird??</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BringBackBanjoK.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Probably my Steam Deck. Just for how much use it gets.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BringBackBanjoK.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My white whale is Cannon Spike for Dreamcast. I don’t really see a scenario where I’m willing to drop insane amounts of money for it though.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games in particular, regarding the recent N64 Recomp projects?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BringBackBanjoK.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Anything and everything people do with the Banjo games will catch my attention.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BringBackBanjoK.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Pepperoni, Mushroom or Anchovy.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BringBackBanjoK.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I just purchased all the GBA Pokemon games. They were not cheap!!!</p>
	<p>Most random purchase I’ve ever made was a sealed copy of Clayfighter for the N64.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Lastly: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/BringBackBanjoK.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">

	<p>Thank you so much for taking part in the ReCollect64 Q&A chats!</p></div>
	</div>
	<p>Some fantastic answers there, and yes, it is weird not to drink or snack while you game!</p>
	<p>Matt runs a nostalgic bear and bird-focused account that is definitely worth following. With facts, artwork, memes and opinions, if you haven't checked out his account, I highly recommend that you check out the link below!</p>
